This was endorsed by the Standards Board in its meeting No. (9) held on 24-25 Rabi\u2019 II, 1415 A.H., corresponding to 19-20 September 1995 A.D., in Bahrain.\nThe empirical study that was conducted by the consultant who commissioned by AAOIFI revealed that Salam financing represented about 5% of the total finance provided by the Islamic banks that participated in the study. The study also showed that the use of Salam financing was mainly in the agriculture sector.\nThe study also showed that there were differences between Islamic banks in the accounting treatments of Salam financing which rendered their financial financial statements non comparable. Furthermore, the Islamic banks did not disclose adequate information in their financial statements on the accounting policies applied to Salam financing.\nSince the use of Salam financing is relatively recent, the initiative by AAOIFI to prepare an accounting standard for this financial instrument is expected to help in reducing the accounting differences that may emerge as a result of Islamic banks developing their own accounting treatments as has been the case with other financial instruments used by Islamic banks, a practice which has resulted in different methods of recognition, measurement, presentation and/or disclosure."

The Accounting Standards Committee recommended the adoption of the alternatives which were considered to be in compliance with the provisions of the previous Statement of Financial Accounting No. (1): Objectives of Financial Accounting for Islamic Banks and Financial Institutions (Statement of Objectives), and Statement of Financial Accounting No. (2): Concepts of Financial Accounting for Islamic Banks and Financial Institutions (Statement of Concepts).\nThe condition that the capital of Salam should be known in a form that determines it constitutes the basis which has been taken to measure the value by which the capital of Salam should be recorded in the Islamic bank\u2019s books when it is paid (in case of Salam) or when it is received (in case of Parallel Salam). If the capital of Salam is in the form of cash, it is identified by the type of currency and its quantity, but if it is in the form of kind or benefit, it is measured by the fair value of such assets or benefits according to what the two contracting parties agree upon. The use of the fair value instead of the historical cost provides users of financial statements with useful information that helps them in their decisions when dealing with Islamic banks. Such an objective is in line with what is provided for in the previous Statement of Objectives. The use of the fair value also leads to the application of the representational faithfulness concept provided for in the previous Statement of Concepts."

However, to ensure reliability of the information provided in the financial statements, the standard provides that if it becomes clear to the Islamic bank that there is a strong probability that Al-Muslam Ileihi will not deliver Al-Muslam Fihi, in full or in part, or there is a strong probability , in full or in part, or there is a strong probability that the value of the Al-Muslam Fihi will decline, a provision should be will decline, a provision should be made of the amount of the estimated deficit. Making such a provision will help in providing information that helps in predicting the Islamic bank\u2019s future cash flows resulting from Salam financing.

This is in line with the provisions of the previous Statement of Concepts regarding the qualitative characteristics of accounting information which the financial statements of Islamic banks should contain.\nThe previous Statement of Concepts gives guidance as to when gains and losses, which are basic elements of the income statement, should be recognized. A loss should, therefore, be recognized once a reciprocal transfer takes place between the Islamic bank and Al-Muslam Ileihi at the time of receiving the substitute of Al-Muslam Fihi. Accordingly, once the Islamic bank accepts the substitute of Al-Muslam Fihi which has a market value lower than the book value of the contracted Al-Muslam Fihi, the difference should be recognized as a loss incurred by the Islamic bank.\nThe Standard differentiates between the failure of Al-Muslam Ileihi to deliver Al-Muslam Fihi due to negligence and misconduct and any other failure to receive Al-Muslam Fihi or part of it at the due date of delivery. The accounting treatment in the standard is in line with one of the objectives of financial accounting which states: \u201cDetermination of the rights and liabilities of all related parties, including any rights ensuing from uncompleted transactions and activities, in accordance with the provisions of Shari\u2019a and its principles of fairness, justice and adherence to the ethics of Islamic dealings.\nAt the end of a financial period, Al-Muslam Fihi is recorded at historical cost or cash equivalent value, whichever is lower.

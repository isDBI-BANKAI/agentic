Fuqaha have also agreed that the delivery should not be contingent on an unknown event; for example, the solvency or the arrival of another person. However, Fuqaha have differed on the issue of the lack of specificity that is considered permissible with regard to the delivery date of Al-Muslam Fihi; for example, during ; for example, during the harvesting season or during the time of Hajj (pilgrimage). The majority of Fuqaha have required a greater degree of specificity of the delivery date, but the Malikis considered that a range of possible delivery dates is acceptable and so did the Hanbalis in one of their versions. It is the latter view that has been adopted in this standard."

Complete nullification of the delivery of Al-Muslam Fihi in return for repayment of the full amount of the capital of Salam is unanimously considered permissible by Fuqaha. Partial cancellation of the delivery of Al-Muslam Fihi in return for the corresponding part of the capital of Salam, with the balance being repaid to Al-Muslam, is considered permissible according to the majority of Fuqaha."

The empirical study revealed that Salam financing represented about 5% of the total finance provided by the Islamic banks that participated in the study. The study also showed that the use of Salam financing was mainly in the agriculture sector. The study also showed that there were differences between Islamic banks in the accounting treatments of Salam financing which rendered their financial financial statements non comparable. Furthermore, the Islamic banks did not disclose adequate information in their financial statements on the accounting policies applied to Salam financing. Since the use of Salam financing is relatively recent, the initiative by AAOIFI to prepare an accounting standard for this financial instrument is expected to help in reducing the accounting differences."

The Accounting Standards Committee recommended the adoption of the alternatives which were considered to be in compliance with the provisions of the previous Statement of Financial Accounting No. (1): Objectives of Financial Accounting for Islamic Banks and Financial Institutions (Statement of Objectives), and Statement of Financial Accounting No. (2): Concepts of Financial Accounting for Islamic Banks and Financial Institutions (Statement of Concepts). The condition that the capital of Salam should be known in a form that determines it constitutes the basis which has been taken to measure the value by which the capital of Salam should be recorded in the Islamic bank\u2019s books when it is paid (in case of Salam) or when it is received (in case of Parallel Salam)."

Accordingly, once the Islamic bank accepts the substitute of Al-Muslam Fihi which has a market value lower than the book value of the contracted Al-Muslam Fihi, the difference should be recognized as a loss incurred by the Islamic bank."

These field studies included the identification of standards that were badly needed and should be given priority by the Financial Accounting Standards Board. The survey revealed the need for early preparation of each of the following standards: a) Murabaha and Murabaha to the Purchase Orderer. b) Musharaka Financing. c) Mudaraba Financing. While preparing the previous Financial Accounting Statement No. (1): Objectives of Financial Accounting for Islamic Banks and Financial Institutions (Statement of Objectives), and Financial Accounting Statement No. (2) : Concept of Financial Accounting for Islamic Banks and Financial Institutions (Statement of Concepts), the consultants were asked to propose nine standards which were considered important and deserved to be given priority in preparation. The consultants were also asked to arrange the proposed standards in order of priority. The selection of the above three standards was based on the decision of the Standards Board in its third meeting held in Tehran on 13 Jumada I, 1413 A.H., corresponding to 8 November 1993 A.D., to give priority to the standards relating to financial instruments. The responses to the field study questionnaire which was conducted by the Accounting and Auditing Organization, showed that the average percentage of transactions in which Musharaka financing is used was 15%.",

This cannot be in the form of a debt on account in order to avoid deception, misunderstanding and inability to make use of the capital. If the capital is in the form of real or intangible assets, Shari\u2019a principles require the valuation of the intangible assets by agreement of the partners, and the Islamic bank\u2019s share in the Musharaka shall be measured at fair value at the time of contracting.

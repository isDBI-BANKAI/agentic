            "content": "The Executive Committee for Planning and Follow-up (the Committee) has commissioned a number of consultants to conduct field studies to identify the objectives and standards of financial accounting and the role of governmental and private bodies in preparing accounting standards in countries in which Islamic banks operate. These field studies included the identification of standards that were badly needed and should be given priority by the Financial Accounting Standards Board. The survey revealed the need for early preparation of each of the following standards: a) Murabaha and Murabaha to the Purchase Orderer. b) Musharaka Financing. c) Mudaraba Financing. While preparing the previous Financial Accounting Statement No. (1): Objectives of Financial Accounting for Islamic Banks and Financial Institutions (Statement of Objectives), and Financial Accounting Statement No. (2) : Concept of Financial Accounting for Islamic Banks and Financial Institutions (Statement of Concepts), the consultants were asked to propose nine standards which were considered important and deserved to be given priority in preparation. The consultants were also asked to arrange the proposed standards in order of priority. The selection of the above three standards was based on the decision of the Standards Board in its third meeting held in Tehran on 13 Jumada I, 1413 A.H., corresponding to 8 November 1993 A.D., to give priority to the standards relating to financial instruments. The responses to the field study questionnaire which was conducted by the Accounting and Auditing Organization, showed that the average percentage of transactions in which Musharaka financing is used was 15%. The questionnaire and the financial reports of some Islamic banks also revealed that there were differences between Islamic banks as to the measurement and recognition of Musharaka financing transactions as well as differences in their methods of presentation and disclosure. Such differences in the accounting practices and disclosure have several effects. It may be difficult to compare profits realized by one Islamic bank with those realized by another. This is likely to render the information produced by an Islamic bank less useful to the users of its financial statements. Such differences may also affect the distribution of the results of joint finance transactions in terms of profit or loss between holders of unrestricted investment accounts and owner\u2019s equity on one hand, and the allocation of profit or loss between holders of unrestricted investment accounts on the other hand. However, standardization of the accounting treatment to recognize and disclose profits conforms with the provisions of the Statement of Objectives; such as determination of the rights and obligations of all concerned parties, including those rights resulting from incomplete transactions and other events in accordance with the principles of Shari\u2019a and its concepts of fairness, charity and compliance with Islamic business ethics; and to provide useful information to users of financial reports of Islamic banks to enable them to make legitimate decisions in their dealing with Islamic banks.",

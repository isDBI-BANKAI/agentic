This shall apply whether the Islamic bank finances its share in Musharaka capital exclusively out of its own funds, out of the pool of commingled funds comprising the Islamic bank\u2019s own funds and unrestricted investment accounts or out of restricted investment accounts. The standard shall also apply to the transactions pertaining to the Islamic bank\u2019s share in Musharaka profits or losses. Should the requirements of this standard contradict the Islamic bank\u2019s charter or the laws and regulations of the country in which it operates, a disclosure should be made of the contradiction. This standard does not include the following: a) Mudaraba; b) Participations; c) Zakah on Musharaka funds; and d) Accounting treatment of Musharaka transactions in the partner\u2019s (client\u2019s) books and the Musharaka records.",

These field studies included the identification of standards that were badly needed and should be given priority by the Financial Accounting Standards Board. The survey revealed the need for early preparation of each of the following standards: a) Murabaha and Murabaha to the Purchase Orderer. b) Musharaka Financing. c) Mudaraba Financing. While preparing the previous Financial Accounting Statement No. (1): Objectives of Financial Accounting for Islamic Banks and Financial Institutions (Statement of Objectives), and Financial Accounting of Objectives), and Financial Accounting Statement No. (2) : Concept of Financial Accounting for Islamic Banks and Financial Institutions (Statement of Concepts), the consultants were asked to propose nine standards which were considered important and deserved to be given priority in preparation.

            "content": "The responses to the field study questionnaire which was conducted by the Accounting and Auditing Organization, showed that the average percentage of transactions in which Musharaka financing is used was 15%. The questionnaire and the financial reports of some Islamic banks also revealed that there were differences between Islamic banks as to the measurement and recognition of Musharaka financing transactions as well as differences in their methods of presentation and disclosure. Such differences in the accounting practices and disclosure have several effects. It may be difficult to compare profits realized by one Islamic bank with those realized by another. This is likely to render the information produced by an Islamic bank less useful to the users of its financial statements. Such differences may also affect the distribution of the results of joint finance transactions in terms of profit or loss between holders of unrestricted investment accounts and owner\u2019s equity on one hand, and the allocation of profit or loss between holders of unrestricted investment accounts on the other hand. However, standardization of the accounting treatment to recognize and disclose profits conforms with the provisions of the Statement of Objectives; such as determination of the rights and obligations of all concerned parties, including those rights resulting from incomplete transactions and other events in accordance with the principles of Shari\u2019a and its concepts of fairness, charity and compliance with Islamic business ethics; and to provide useful information to users of financial reports of Islamic banks to enable them to make legitimate decisions in their dealing with Islamic banks.",

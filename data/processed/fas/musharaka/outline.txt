      - 1/3/3 Rules of profit — `profit_rules`
        - a) General rules of profit — `profit_rules`
          - 1. Profit should be quantifiable. If it is not, this will undermine the contractual basis of the partnership through leading to differences and disputes at the time of profit allocation or liquidation of the partnership. If the partners say that the “profit will be between us”, profit will in this case be allocated according to the share of each of them in the capital. — `profit_rules`
          - 2. Each partner’s profit must be a proportionate share of the whole partnership profit. No predetermined amount may be assigned to one of the partners, as in this case profit sharing will not take place and the legal basis of the partnership will be undermined. — `profit_rules`
        - b) Rules of allocating profits among partners — `profit_allocation_rules`
          - First: Profit should be divided among the partners in pro- por tion to their contributed capital, whether the amount of work done by the partners is equal or not. This is the opinion of Malikis and Shafis and their argument is based on the grounds that profit is the return on capital, hence it must be proportional thereto. Preferential treatment in profit sharing com- bined with equality of capital contribution leads to a return on an amount that has not been committed. — `profit_allocation_rules`
          - Second: Profit may vary between the partners if it is so provided for in the contract. This is the opinion of Hana- fis and Hanbalis, and their argument is based on the pro- position that profit is the fruit of the interaction of funds and work. — `profit_allocation_rules`

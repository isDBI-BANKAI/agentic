Scope of the Standard\n\nThis standard shall apply to Musharaka financing transactions carried out by Islamic banks whether by means of a constant Musharaka (short or long-term) or a diminishing Musharaka (one which ends with transferring ownership to one party). This shall apply whether the Islamic bank finances its share in Musharaka capital exclusively out of its own funds, out of the pool of commingled funds comprising the Islamic bank\u2019s own funds and unrestricted investment accounts or out of restricted investment accounts. The standard shall also apply to the transactions pertaining to the Islamic bank\u2019s share in Musharaka profits or losses. Should the requirements of this standard contradict the Islamic bank\u2019s charter or the laws and regulations of the country in which it operates, a disclosure should be made of the contradiction. This standard does not include the following: a) Mudaraba; b) Participations; c) Zakah on Musharaka funds; and d) Accounting treatment of Musharaka transactions in the partner\u2019s (client\u2019s) books and the Musharaka records."

These field studies included the identification of standards that were badly needed and should be given priority by the Financial Accounting Standards Board. The survey revealed the need for early preparation of each of the following standards: a) Murabaha and Murabaha to the Purchase Orderer. b) Musharaka Financing. c) Mudaraba Financing. While preparing the previous Financial Accounting Statement No. (1): Objectives of Financial Accounting for Islamic Banks and Financial Institutions (Statement of Objectives), and Financial Accounting of Objectives), and Financial Accounting Statement No. (2) : Concept of Financial Accounting for Islamic Banks and Financial Institutions (Statement of Concepts), the consultants were asked to propose nine standards which were considered important and deserved to be given priority in preparation.

The questionnaire and the financial reports of some Islamic banks also revealed that there were differences between Islamic banks as to the measurement and recognition of Musharaka financing transactions as well as differences in their methods of presentation and disclosure. Such differences in the accounting practices and disclosure have several effects. It may be difficult to compare profits realized by one Islamic bank with those realized by another. This is likely to render the information produced by an Islamic bank less useful to the users of its financial statements. Such differences may also affect the distribution of the results of joint finance transactions in terms of profit or loss between holders of unrestricted investment accounts and owner\u2019s equity on one hand, and the allocation of profit or loss between holders of unrestricted investment accounts on the other hand. However, standardization of the accounting treatment to recognize and disclose profits conforms with the provisions of the Statement of Objectives; such as determination of the rights and obligations of all concerned parties, including those rights resulting from incomplete transactions and other events in accordance with the principles of Shari\u2019a and its concepts of fairness, charity and compliance with Islamic business ethics; and to provide useful information to users of financial reports of Islamic banks to enable them to make legitimate decisions in their dealing with Islamic banks."

This cannot be in the form of a debt on account in order to avoid deception, misunderstanding and inability to make use of the capital.

        "content": "Financial Accounting Standard No. (4): Musharaka Financing > Appendix (D) > Recognition of the Islamic Bank\u2019s Share in the Profit or Loss of Musharaka\n\nThe standard distinguished between Musharaka financing transactions (constant or diminishing ownership) which end during a financial period, and those which continue for more than one financial period. In the first case, the profits or losses are recognized after liquidation. This is in conformity with the Shari\u2019a principle stating: No profit shall be deemed due except after maintaining the capital; i.e., after liquidation which reveals an excess (profit) over the initial capital or shortage (loss) therefrom. In the second case, if the Musharaka financing transactions continue for more than one financial period, the Islamic bank\u2019s share of profits for a financial period resulting from partial or final settlement shall be recognized to the extent that the profits are being distributed; recognition of the Islamic bank\u2019s share of losses for any period is made to the extent that such losses are being deducted from its share of the Musharaka capital. This is in conformity with the periodicity concept (Statement of Concepts, para. 74) which enables the preparation of financial reports in such a way as to achieve the objective set out in the Statement of Objectives (para. 33): Determining the rights and obligations of all concerned parties."

It is conducted between investment accountholders as owners of capital and the Islamic bank as a Mudarib. The Islamic bank announces its willingness to accept the funds of investment amount holders, the sharing of profits being as agreed upon between the two parties, and the losses being borne by the owner of funds except if they were due to misconduct, negligence or violation of the conditions agreed upon by the Islamic bank. In the latter cases such losses would be borne by the Islamic bank. A Mudaraba contract may also be concluded between the Islamic bank, as a provider of capital on behalf of itself or on behalf of investment accountholders, and business owners and other craftsmen, including farmers, traders etc. A Mudaraba cannot include market operations undertaken for purely speculative purposes, which are a form of gambling."

The accounting treatments by the Islamic banks of Istisna\u2019a and parallel Istisna\u2019a give rise to numerous problems due to the multiplicity of alternatives available for the treatment of many issues. Among the issues that are susceptible to significant differences in the accounting treatment are: \u25a0 \u25a0 Measurement and recognition of the costs of Istisna\u2019a and parallel Istisna\u2019a Measurement and recognition of the costs of Istisna\u2019a and parallel Istisna\u2019a contracts. \u25a0 \u25a0 Measurement and recognition of the revenues and profits of Istisna\u2019a Measurement and recognition of the revenues and profits of Istisna\u2019a and parallel Istisna\u2019a contracts. \u25a0 \u25a0 Valuation of Istisna\u2019a assets at the end of a financial period, especially Valuation of Istisna\u2019a assets at the end of a financial period, especially when contract losses are expected. \u25a0 \u25a0 Measurement and treatment of contract maintenance and warranty Measurement and treatment of contract maintenance and warranty costs. \u25a0 \u25a0 Scope and mode of disclosure of accounting information and policies Scope and mode of disclosure of accounting information and policies relating to Istisna\u2019a and parallel Istisna\u2019a transactions in the financial statements of the Islamic bank. Differences in the accounting treatments of such issues and their disclosure in the financial statements of the Islamic bank are expected to have adverse effects on the comparability of accounting information presented in the financial statements of Islamic banks. Thus, the standardisation of accounting treatments of Istisna\u2019a and parallel Istisna\u2019a transactions on bases consistent with Statement of Financial Accounting No. (1): Objectives of Financial Accounting for Islamic Banks and Financial Institutions (Statement of Objectives), and the Statement of Financial Accounting No. (2): Concepts of Financial Accounting for Islamic Banks and Financial Institutions (Statement of Concepts) is necessary in order to provide useful information to users of the financial reports of these banks and for ensuring comparability of such information."

(1) Attached with the standard are details of the juristic bases for the accounting treatments. Istisna\u2019a contract is usually accompanied with a separate parallel contract, whereby an Islamic bank acts in the first contract as a seller (Al-Sani\u2019) of goods (Al-Masnoo\u2019, the subject-matter of the contract) to an ultimate buyer (Al-Mustasni\u2019) while in the parallel Istisna\u2019a contract the Islamic bank acts as a buyer (Al-Mustasni\u2019) of Al-Masnoo\u2019 from another seller (Al-Sani\u2019)."

Scope of the Standard\n\nThis standard addresses the accounting rules of Istisna\u2019a and parallel Istisna\u2019a contracts in the financial statements of Islamic banks relating to measuring and recognizing the costs and revenues from Istisna\u2019a and parallel Istisna\u2019a, the gains and losses accruing therefrom, and their presentation and disclosure in the financial statements of the Islamic bank. Should the requirements of this standard contradict the Islamic bank\u2019s charter or the laws and regulations of the country in which it operates and the Islamic bank had to comply with such requirements, a disclosure should be made to the point of conflict."

After taking into consideration the replies from the Islamic banks, the Accounting and Auditing Standards Board decided in its meeting No. (10) held on 14-16 Ramadan 1416 A.H., corresponding to 3-5 February 1996 A.D., in Jeddah, Kingdom of Saudi Arabia, to give priority to the preparation of a standard on Istisna\u2019a and parallel Istisna\u2019a. On 1 Dhul-Qa\u2019dah 1417 A.H., corresponding to 10 March 1997 A.D., two consultants were commissioned to prepare the preliminary studies on the juristic and accounting aspects of the standard. These studies were dis- cussed in the Accounting Standards Committee meeting No. (11), held on 7 Safar 1418 A.H., corresponding to 12 June 1997 A.D., in Bahrain. The revised juristic and accounting studies as well as an exposure draft of the standard were discussed by the Committee in its meeting No. (12) held during the period of 13-14 Jumada I, 1418 A.H., corresponding to 14-15 September 1997 A.D., in Bahrain. In its meeting No. (13) held during the period of 12-13 Jumada II, 1418 A.H., corresponding to 13-14 October 1997 A.D., in Doha, the Committee reviewed and discussed the revised exposure draft of the standard and necessary amendments were made in light of the discussions that took place and the comments made by the members. The exposure draft was submitted to the Shari\u2019a Committee in its meeting No. (8), held on 13-15 Rajab, 1418 AH., corresponding to 13-15 November, 1997 A.D., in Bahrain, and the amendments which it deemed necessary were made. The amended exposure draft was discussed in the Standards Board meeting No. (14) held on 11-12 Ramadan 1418 A.H., corresponding to 10-11 January 1998 A.D., in Jeddah, Kingdom of Saudi Arabia. The Standards Board made further amendments to the exposure draft and decided that it should be distributed to specialists and interested parties to obtain their comments on the exposure draft in order to discuss them in a listening session. Two listening sessions were held, one in Pakistan on 18 Dhul-Hajjah 1418 A.H., corresponding to 15 April 1998 A.D., and the other in Bahrain on 22 Dhul-Hajjah 1418 A.H., corresponding to 19 April 1998 A.D. The listening session s were attended by more than 230 participants representing central banks, Islamic banks, accounting firms, Shari\u2019a scholars, academics and others who are interested in this field. Members of the Accounting Standards Committee responded in the listening sessions as well as the s as well as the oral comments that were expressed in the sessions of the listening sessions.s. The Accounting Standards Committee held a meeting on 22 Dhul-Hajjah 1418 A.H., corresponding to 19 April 1998 A.D., to discuss the comments made about the exposure draft. The Committee made the necessary amend- ments which it deemed necessary in light of the discussions that took place in the two listening sessions. The revised exposure draft was reviewed and approved by the Shari\u2019a Committee in its meeting No. (8) which was held on 18-19 Muharram 1419 A.H., corresponding to 14-15 May 1998 A.D., after making some changes to the draft. The Accounting and Auditing Standards Board adopted the proposed standard in its meeting No. (15) held on 27-28 Safar 1419 A.H., corresponding to 21-22 June 1998 A.D."

Hence, according to this viewpoint, Istisna\u2019a is subject to the same provisions and rules as those regulating the contract of Salam. (5) It should, however, be noted that the emergence of Istisna\u2019a as a separate and independent contract is a result of jurisprudential engineering of the Hanafi school as presented in \u201cMajallat Al-Ahkam Al-\u2019Adliyyah\u201d and and the resolution of the Islamic Figh Academy. (6) This study is, therefore, This study is, therefore, based on the provisions of the Istisna\u2019a contract as developed in the Hanafis\u2019 jurisprudence and the subsequent development from within that jurisprudence and from other contemporary jurists."

Definition\n\nIstisna\u2019a is a sale contract between Al-Mustasni\u2019 (the buyer) and Al-Sani\u2019 (the seller), whereby Al-Sani\u2019 based on an order from Al-Mustasni\u2019 undertakes to have manufactured or otherwise acquired Al-Masnoo\u2019 (the subject matter of the contract) according to the specifications and sell it to Al-Mustasni\u2019 for an agreed upon price and method of settlement whether that be in advance, by instalments or deferred to a specific future time. (8) It is a condition of the Istisna\u2019a contract that Al-Sani\u2019 should provide either the raw material or the labour."

Legitimacy of Istisna\u2019a > 3/1 According to the Hanafis, Istisna\u2019a\u2019 ought to have been prohibited for contravening the general Shari\u2019a rules of Qiyas (analogical deduction).\n\nThey base their argument on the fact that the subject-matter of a contract of sale ought to be in existence and in possession of the seller, which is not the case in Istisna\u2019a. The Hanafis have, nevertheless, approved the Istisna\u2019a contract on the basis of Istihsan (juristic approbation) for the following reasons: a) People have been practicing Istisna\u2019a widely and continuously without condemnation, to the extent of furnishing a case of Ijma\u2019 (Consensus). b) It is possible in Shari\u2019a to depart from Qiyas based on Ijma\u2019. c) The validity of Istisna\u2019a is called for on grounds of need. People are often in need of commodities that are not available in the market, and hence, they would tend to enter into contracts to have the goods manufactured for them. (9)"

If a date is fixed, then the contract turns into Salam because this is a characteristic of a binding contract such as Salam, but not Istisna\u2019a which is open for options. b) Abu Yusuf and Muhammad Ibn Al-Hasan Al-Shaybani, the companions of Abu Hanifah, accepted the condition of fixing a specific future delivery date on the ground that people have been practicing Istisna\u2019a in that manner. c) However, Abu Hanifah and his two companions have agreed that in an Istisna\u2019a contract if a delivery date is fixed and it is not in line with what is commonly practised, then the Istisna\u2019a contract turns into a Salam contract. This standard accommodates the opinion of the two com- panions of Abu Hanifah who permit fixing a future delivery date. Therefore, fixing a future delivery date is a necessity. This is in line with both the ruling of the Committee of \u201cMa- jallat Al-Ahkam Al-\u2019Adliyyah\u201d, which stipulates that Istisna\u2019a is a binding contract, and the resolution of the Islamic Fiqh Academy. This is based on for the following: a) Al-Masnoo\u2019 is a product that should either be manufactured or obtained from the market. Therefore, fixing a future de- livery date becomes a necessity in order to remove Gharar (uncertainty). b) The future delivery date depends, on one hand, on the mutual agreement between the two parties involved and on the other hand, on the time required by Al-Sani\u2019 to manufacture Al- Masnoo\u2019 and/or to obtain Al-Masnoo\u2019 from other parties according to the contract. c) In Istisna\u2019a contract, fixing a future delivery date is allowed when the need and necessity arise irrespective to whether or not it is commonly practised by people."

Price may be changed by mutual consent of the contracting parties because of making modification in Al-Masnoo\u2019 or due to unforeseen contingencies."

Legal Consequences of Istisna\u2019a\n\nAccording to the majority of Hanafi jurists, the legal consequences of Istisna\u2019a are: (I) to transfer reciprocally title of ownership between Al-Mustasni\u2019 and Al-Sani\u2019; and (II) to establish the entitlement of Al- Sani\u2019 to the agreed upon amount of the contract. This is because Istisna\u2019a is a binding contract. (15) This is the view adopted by recent This is the view adopted by recent civil Islamic legislations, and modern transactions, whereby both the transfer of title of ownership is automatic and unconditional and Al-Sani\u2019 is entitled to the agreed upon amount once the contract is constituted.

Options on Non-Compliance with Specifications\n\nIf Al-Masnoo\u2019 is not in conformity with the specifications, Al-Mustasni\u2019 has the following options: a) Reject Al-Masnoo\u2019, or b) Accept it without seeking damages."

Parallel Istisna\u2019a\n\nIf Al-Mustasni\u2019 (the ultimate purchaser) did not stipulate in the contract that Al-Sani\u2019 (the seller) should manufacture the Al-Masnoo\u2019 by himself, then Al-Sani\u2019 may enter into a second Istisna\u2019a contract in order to fulfil his contractual obligations in the first contract. This new contract is known as parallel Istisna\u2019a, which is in essence a subcontract whereby the obligation of Al-Sani\u2019 in the first contract are carried out. Nevertheless,: a) The Islamic bank as Al-Sani\u2019 in the first contract will remain solely responsible for the execution of his obligations as if the parallel contract is nonexistent. Hence, Al-Sani\u2019 in the first contract would remain liable for any default, negligence or breach of contract ensuing from the parallel contract. b) Al-Sani\u2019 in the parallel Istisna\u2019a is accountable to Al-Mustasni\u2019 (the Islamic bank) in the way and manner by which he performs his obligations. He has no direct legal relationship with Al-Mustasni\u2019 in the first contract. The second Istisna\u2019a is a parallel contract, but not a contingent transaction on the first contract. Legally speaking they are different contracts with respect to the rights and obligations. c) The Islamic bank as Al-Sani\u2019 is liable to Al-Mustasni\u2019 with regard to any mal-execution of the subcontractor and any guarantees arising therefrom. It is this very liability that justifies the validity of the parallel Istisna\u2019a and which also justifies the charging of profit by the Islamic bank, if any. (20)"

The accounting treatments by the Islamic banks of Istisna\u2019a and parallel Istisna\u2019a give rise to numerous problems due to the multiplicity of alternatives available for the treatment of many issues."

The Accounting Standards Committee recommended the adoption of the alternatives which were considered to be in compliance with the previous Statement of Financial Accounting No. (1): Objectives of Financial Accounting for Islamic Banks and Financial Institutions (Statement of Objectives), and the Statement of Financial Accounting No. (2): Concepts of Financial Accounting for Islamic Banks and Financial Institutions (Statement of Concepts)."

        "content": "Financial Accounting Standard No. (10): Istisna\u2019a and Parallel Istisna\u2019a > Recognition of Istisna\u2019a Profit\n\nTwo alternative treatments were proposed for the recognition of Istisna\u2019a profit: a) Percentage of completion method. According to this method, a por- tion of Istisna\u2019a profit commensurate with the work completed during a period is recognized at the end of the period as a realized profit. That is, Istisna\u2019a profit is allocated over the periods in which the contract is being executed in proportion to the work completed in each period. A crucial condition for applying this method is that the expected cost of completing the contract is estimated with reasonable accuracy.

        "content": "Financial Accounting Standard No. (10): Istisna\u2019a and Parallel Istisna\u2019a > a) Completed contract method\n\nAccording to this method, the entire contract costs and revenues of Istisna\u2019a contract are recognized at the end of the financial period during which the contract is completed.\nThe first alternative; i.e., percentage of completion method, was chosen for the recognition of Istisna\u2019a and parallel Istisna\u2019a profit, provided that the contract costs can be estimated with reasonable accuracy. However, if the contract costs cannot be estimated with reasonable accuracy, the completed contract method should be used.\nThe percentage of completion method is preferred because it provides for a better matching of Istisna\u2019a revenues and expenses. Furthermore, it reflects in a more accurate manner the outcome of the earning activities of Al-Sani\u2019 (the Islamic bank) over the entire time period of contract execution, thereby presenting more relevant information to users of the financial statements.\nFurthermore, the percentage of completion method enables investment accountholders to participate in Istisna\u2019a profit as long as they have a contractual relationship with the Islamic bank. However, postponing the recognition of revenue and profits until the contract is completed (i.e., using the completed contract method) denies investment accountholders from their share in Istisna\u2019a profits should they withdraw their funds before the contract is completed. Therefore, the second alternative (the completed contract method) should be applied only in unusual circumstances, i.e., when the first alternative (the percentage of completion method) is not applicable."

Hence, Istisna\u2019a assets would not be inflated as would happen if these assets were not written down to account for the expected losses.

When incurred, actual maintenance and warranty expenditures are charged against the maintenance and warranty allowance account. b) Cash basis: According to this basis actual maintenance and warranty costs are charged against income for the financial period in which they take place. The accrual basis (the first alternative) was chosen for Istisna\u2019a contracts because it provides for a better matching of Istisna\u2019a revenues and expenses. The cash basis (the second alternative), however, was chosen for parallel Istisna\u2019a contracts based on the materiality concept because in a parallel Istisna\u2019a such costs are born by Al-Sani\u2019 (i.e., the subcontractor)."

Characterisation of Istisna\u2019a\n\nAccording to the majority of Fuqaha (juristic scholars), Istisna\u2019a is a special type of Salam contract, which is used mainly in the field of manufacturing. Hence, according to this viewpoint, Istisna\u2019a is subject to the same provisions and rules as those regulating the contract of Salam. It should, however, be noted that the emergence of Istisna\u2019a as a separate and independent contract is a result of jurisprudential engineering of the Hanafi school as presented in \u201cMajallat Al-Ahkam Al-\u2019Adliyyah\u201d and the resolution of the Islamic Figh Academy. This study is, therefore, based on the provisions of the Istisna\u2019a contract as developed in the Hanafis\u2019 jurisprudence and the subsequent development from within that jurisprudence and from other contemporary jurists."

Definition\n\nIstisna\u2019a is a sale contract between Al-Mustasni\u2019 (the buyer) and Al-Sani\u2019 (the seller), whereby Al-Sani\u2019\u2014based on an order from Al-Mustasni\u2019\u2014undertakes to have manufactured or otherwise acquired Al-Masnoo\u2019 (the subject matter of the contract) according to the specifications and sell it to Al-Mustasni\u2019 for an agreed upon price and method of settlement whether that be in advance, by instalments or deferred to a specific future time. It is a condition of the Istisna\u2019a contract that Al-Sani\u2019 should provide either the raw material or the labour."

They base their argument on the fact that the subject-matter of a contract of sale ought to be in existence and in possession of the seller, which is not the case in Istisna\u2019a. The Hanafis have, nevertheless, approved the Istisna\u2019a contract on the basis of Istihsan (juristic approbation) for the following reasons: a) People have been practicing Istisna\u2019a widely and continuously without condemnation, to the extent of furnishing a case of Ijma\u2019. b) It is possible in Shari\u2019a to depart from Qiyas based on Ijma\u2019. c) The validity of Istisna\u2019a is called for on grounds of need."

This arrangement makes the delivery of the subject-matter free from Gharar (uncertainty)."

This is important because the legitimacy of Istisna\u2019a is based, according to their viewpoint, on the customary practices of people. However, since the legitimacy of Istisna\u2019a is also based on Qiyas, general rules of Shari\u2019a, permissibility of whatever has not been considered illegitimate, and Maslaha (consideration of the public good or common need), it is therefore considered a permissible contract to be used whenever the need arises irrespective to whether or not it has been commonly practised by people."

Conditions for the Validity of Istisna\u2019a > 4/1 Al-Masnoo\u2019 > 4/1/3\n\nThere are three opinions in the Hanafis School relating to fixing a date for delivering Al-Masnoo\u2019. a) Imam Abu Hanifa prevented fixing any future date for the delivery of Al-Masnoo\u2019. If a date is fixed, then the contract turns into Salam because this is a characteristic of a binding contract such as Salam, but not Istisna\u2019a which is open for options. b) Abu Yusuf and Muhammad Ibn Al-Hasan Al-Shaybani, the companions of Abu Hanifah, accepted the condition of fixing a specific future delivery date on the ground that people have been practicing Istisna\u2019a in that manner. c) However, Abu Hanifah and his two companions have agreed that in an Istisna\u2019a contract if a delivery date is fixed and it is not in line with what is commonly practised, then the Istisna\u2019a contract turns into a Salam contract."

Binding Nature of Istisna\u2019a > 5/1\n\nAccording to the majority of Hanafi jurists, Istisna\u2019a is a valid but not binding contract. Each partner has the option to rescind the contract before it is implemented. Al-Sani\u2019 has the right not to commence manufacturing the goods, while Al-Mustasni\u2019 has the right to withdraw from buying Al-Masnoo\u2019. If Al-Sani\u2019 manufactured Al-Masnoo\u2019, he would not be obliged to deliver it to Al-Mustasni\u2019. Rather, he has the option to dispense with it in the way he deems fit. This is because the contract is not for the manufactured goods themselves, but for Al-Masnoo\u2019 of certain specifications. Al-Mustasni\u2019 also has the option to accept Al-Masnoo\u2019. The Hanafis have three different views if Al-Sani\u2019 manufactured Al-Masnoo\u2019 according to the specifications and decided to deliver it to Al-Mustasni\u2019 in fulfillment of his contractual obligations. These are: a) The preponderant view is that the contract becomes binding on Al-Sani\u2019 who has waived his option by delivering Al-Masnoo\u2019. Yet, the buyer\u2019s option remains to be exercised. This view is attributed to the three Imams: Abu Hanifah, Abu Yusuf, and Muhammad. b) Abu Hanifah is also reported to have said that even at this stage Al-Sani\u2019 retains his right on an equal footing with Al-Mustasni\u2019. c) Abu Yusuf is also reported to have expressed a second opinion to the effect that in this situation the contract becomes binding on the two parties."

Binding Nature of Istisna\u2019a > 5/3\n\nProvision (392) of 'Majallat Al-Ahkam Al-\u2019Adliyyah' reads as follows: Once the contract of Istisna\u2019a is constituted, it becomes binding and no party has the right to revoke it. If, however, Al-Masnoo\u2019 does not conform to the required specifications, Al-Mustasni\u2019 has the option to revoke the contract. The commentator on the text says: Istisna\u2019a is a contract of sale and not a mere promise. Once it is constituted, no party, according to Abu Yousuf\u2019s point of view, has the right to withdraw unless the consent of the other party is secured. Accordingly, Al-Sani\u2019 has to deliver Al-Masnoo\u2019."

These are the Jordanian, Yemeni and Sudanese laws of civil transactions as well as the Unified Arab Law proposed by the League of Arab Countries."

These views strengthen one another and confirm that there is a substantiated viewpoint in the Hanafi school professing the binding nature of Istisna\u2019a once it is constituted. It is on this reality that the 'Majallat Al-Ahkam Al-\u2019Adliyyah', modern civil Islamic legislations and the Islamic Fiqh Academy developed their viewpoint, which is consistent with Shari\u2019a rules and principles."

Legal Consequences of Istisna\u2019a\n\nAccording to the majority of Hanafi jurists, the legal consequences of Istisna\u2019a are: (I) to transfer reciprocally title of ownership between Al-Mustasni\u2019 and Al-Sani\u2019; and (II) to establish the entitlement of Al-Sani\u2019 to the agreed upon amount of the contract. This is because Istisna\u2019a is a binding contract. This is the view adopted by recent civil Islamic legislations, and modern transactions, whereby both the transfer of title of ownership is automatic and unconditional and Al-Sani\u2019 is entitled to the agreed upon amount once the contract is constituted."

Parallel Istisna\u2019a\n\nIf Al-Mustasni\u2019 (the ultimate purchaser) did not stipulate in the contract that Al-Sani\u2019 (the seller) should manufacture the Al-Masnoo\u2019 by himself, then Al-Sani\u2019 may enter into a second Istisna\u2019a contract in order to fulfil his contractual obligations in the first contract. This new contract is known as parallel Istisna\u2019a, which is in essence a subcontract whereby the obligation of Al-Sani\u2019 in the first contract are carried out. Nevertheless: a) The Islamic bank as Al-Sani\u2019 in the first contract will remain solely responsible for the execution of his obligations as if the parallel contract is nonexistent. Hence, Al-Sani\u2019 in the first contract would remain liable for any default, negligence or breach of contract ensuing from the parallel contract. b) Al-Sani\u2019 in the parallel Istisna\u2019a is accountable to Al-Mustasni\u2019 (the Islamic bank) in the way and manner by which he performs his obligations. He has no direct legal relationship with Al-Mustasni\u2019 in the first contract. The second Istisna\u2019a is a parallel contract, but not a contingent transaction on the first contract. Legally speaking they are different contracts with respect to the rights and obligations. c) The Islamic bank as Al-Sani\u2019 is liable to Al-Mustasni\u2019 with regard to any mal-execution of the subcontractor and any guarantees arising therefrom. It is this very liability that justifies the validity of the parallel Istisna\u2019a and which also justifies the charging of profit by the Islamic bank, if any."

  - Appendix (C) Juristic Rules for Istisna’a and Parallel Istisna’a — [juristic_rules]
    - 1. Characterisation of Istisna’a — [characterization]
    - 2. Definition — [definition]
    - 3. Legitimacy of Istisna’a — [legitimacy]
      - 3/1 According to the Hanafis, Istisna’a’ ought to have been prohibited for contravening the general Shari’a rules of Qiyas (analogical deduction). — [legitimacy]
      - 3/2 Istisna’a is also valid in accordance with the general rule of the permissibility of contracts as long as this does not contravene any text or rule of Shari’a. — [legitimacy]
      - 3/3 Some contemporary Fuqaha are of the view that Istisna’a is valid on the basis of Qiyas and the general rules of Shari’a because the fact that the subject-matter is non-existent at the time of the constitution of the contract is compensated for by its preponderant existence at the time of delivery in the future. This arrangement makes the delivery of the subject-matter free from Gharar (uncertainty). (10) — [legitimacy]
    - 4. Conditions for the Validity of Istisna’a (11) — [conditions]
    - 4/1 Al-Masnoo’ — [conditions]
      - 4/1/1 Al-Masnoo’ must be known and specified to the extent of removing any lack of knowledge of its: a) Kind, e.g., car, airoplane or house, etc.; b) Type, e.g., a Toyota car, a Boeing airoplane, a house for low income individuals, etc.; c) Quality, e.g., as specified according to established tables of specifications; and d) Quantity. — [conditions]
      - 4/1/2 The Hanafis stipulate that the commodity contracted for ought to be of a type of items that people are used to dealing with through Istisna’a. This is important because the legitimacy of Istisna’a is based, according to their viewpoint, on the customary practices of people. However, since the legitimacy of Istisna’a is also based on Qiyas, general rules of Shari’a, permissibility of whatever has not been considered illegitimate, and Maslaha (consideration of the public good or common need), it is therefore considered a permissible contract to be used whenever the need arises irrespective to whether or not it has been commonly practised by people. — [conditions]
      - 4/1/3 Fixing a date for delivering Al-Masnoo’ — [conditions]
    - 4/2 Price — [conditions]
    - 5. Binding Nature of Istisna’a — [binding_nature]
      - 5/1 According to the majority of Hanafi jurists, Istisna’a is a valid but not binding contract. Hence,: — [binding_nature]
        - 5/1/1 Each partner has the option to rescind the contract before it is implemented. Al-Sani’ has the right not to commence manufacturing the goods, while Al-Mustasni’ has the right to withdraw from buying Al-Masnoo’. — [binding_nature]
        - 5/1/2 If Al-Sani’ manufactured Al-Masnoo’, he would not be obliged to deliver it to Al-Mustasni’. Rather, he has the option to dispense with it in the way he deems fit. This is because the contract is not for the manufactured goods themselves, but for Al-Masnoo’ of certain specifications. Al-Mustasni’ also has the option to accept Al-Masnoo’. — [binding_nature]
        - 5/1/3 The Hanafis have three different views if Al-Sani’ manufac- tured Al-Masnoo’ according to the specifications and decided to deliver it to Al-Mustasni’ in fulfillment of his contractual obligations. These are: a) The preponderant view is that the contract becomes binding on Al-Sani’ who has waived his option by delivering Al- Masnoo’. Yet, the buyer’s option remains to be exercised. This view is attributed to the three Imams: Abu Hanifah, Abu Yusuf and Muhammad. b) Abu Hanifah is also reported to have said that even at this stage Al-Sani’ retains his right on an equal footing with Al- Mustasni’. c) Abu Yusuf is also reported to have expressed a second opinion to the effect that in this situation the contract becomes binding on the two parties. (12) — [binding_nature]
      - 5/2 The majority in the Hanafi School opined that the Istisna’a contract is binding once it has been constituted. A number of jurists have argued in favour of this view. (13) — [binding_nature]
      - 5/3 Provision (392) of “Majallat Al-Ahkam Al-’Adliyyah” reads as follows: reads as follows: Once the contract of Istisna’a is constituted, it becomes binding and no party has the right to revoke it. If, however, Al-Masnoo’ does not conform to the required specifications, Al-Mustasni’ has the option to revoke the contract. The commentator on the text says: Istisna’a is a contract of sale and not a mere promise. Once it is constituted, no party, according to Abu Yousuf’s point of view, has the right to withdraw unless the consent of the other party is secured (see article 375). Accordingly, Al-Sani’ has to deliver Al-Masnoo’. (14) — [binding_nature]
      - 5/4 In light of the above, all civil legislations based on Shari’a have treated Istisna’a, in line with the ruling of “Majallat Al-Ahkam Al-’Adliyyah”, as a binding contract. These are the Jordanian, Yemeni and Sudanese laws of civil transactions as well as the Unified Arab Law proposed by the League of Arab Countries. — [binding_nature]
      - 5/5 The Islamic Fiqh Academy has also decreed: “The contract of Istisna’a is binding on its parties provided that certain conditions are fulfilled.” These views strengthen one another and confirm that there is a substantiated viewpoint in the Hanafi school professing the bind- ing nature of Istisna’a once it is constituted. It is on this reality that the “Majallat Al-Ahkam Al-’Adliyyah”, modern civil Islamic legis- , modern civil Islamic legis- lations and the Islamic Fiqh Academy developed their viewpoint, which is consistent with Shari’a rules and principles. — [binding_nature]

    - 7. Guarantee — [guarantee]
      - 7/1 Al-Mustasni’ has the right to obtain collateral from Al-Sani’ for: a) The total amount that he has paid. b) The delivery of Al-Masnoo’ in accordance with the specifications and on due time. — [guarantee]

(1) Attached with the standard are details of the juristic bases for the accounting treatments. Istisna\u2019a contract is usually accompanied with a separate parallel contract, whereby an Islamic bank acts in the first contract as a seller (Al-Sani\u2019) of goods (Al-Masnoo\u2019, the subject-matter of the contract) to an ultimate buyer (Al-Mustasni\u2019) while in the parallel Istisna\u2019a contract the Islamic bank acts as a buyer (Al-Mustasni\u2019) of Al-Masnoo\u2019 from another seller (Al-Sani\u2019).",

Should the requirements of this standard contradict the Islamic bank\u2019s charter or the laws and regulations of the country in which it operates and the Islamic bank had to comply with such requirements, a disclosure should be made to the point of conflict.",

            "content": "On 30 Jumada I, 1416 A.H., corresponding to 24 October 1995 A.D., a letter was sent to the Islamic banks to seek their opinion on the standards to be given priority. After taking into consideration the replies from the Islamic banks, the Accounting and Auditing Standards Board decided in its meeting No. (10) held on 14-16 Ramadan 1416 A.H., corresponding to 3-5 February 1996 A.D., in Jeddah, Kingdom of Saudi Arabia, to give priority to the preparation of a standard on Istisna\u2019a and parallel Istisna\u2019a. On 1 Dhul-Qa\u2019dah 1417 A.H., corresponding to 10 March 1997 A.D., two consultants were commissioned to prepare the preliminary studies on the juristic and accounting aspects of the standard. These studies were dis- cussed in the Accounting Standards Committee meeting No. (11), held on 7 Safar 1418 A.H., corresponding to 12 June 1997 A.D., in Bahrain. The revised juristic and accounting studies as well as an exposure draft of the standard were discussed by the Committee in its meeting No. (12) held during the period of 13-14 Jumada I, 1418 A.H., corresponding to 14-15 September 1997 A.D., in Bahrain. In its meeting No. (13) held during the period of 12-13 Jumada II, 1418 A.H., corresponding to 13-14 October 1997 A.D., in Doha, the Committee reviewed and discussed the revised exposure draft of the standard and necessary amendments were made in light of the discussions that took place and the comments made by the members. The exposure draft was submitted to the Shari\u2019a Committee in its meeting No. (8), held on 13-15 Rajab, 1418 AH., corresponding to 13-15 November, 1997 A.D., in Bahrain, and the amendments which it deemed necessary were made. The amended exposure draft was discussed in the Standards Board meeting No. (14) held on 11-12 Ramadan 1418 A.H., corresponding to 10-11 January 1998 A.D., in Jeddah, Kingdom of Saudi Arabia. The Standards Board made further amendments to the exposure draft and decided that it should be distributed to specialists and interested parties to obtain their comments on the exposure draft in order to discuss them in a listening session. Two listening sessions were held, one in Pakistan on 18 Dhul-Hajjah 1418 A.H., corresponding to 15 April 1998 A.D., and the other in Bahrain on 22 Dhul-Hajjah 1418 A.H., corresponding to 19 April 1998 A.D. The listening session s were attended by more than 230 participants representing central banks, Islamic banks, accounting firms, Shari\u2019a scholars, academics and others who are interested in this field. Members of the Accounting Standards Committee responded in the listening sessions as well as the s as well as the oral comments that were expressed in the sessions of the listening sessions.s. The Accounting Standards Committee held a meeting on 22 Dhul-Hajjah 1418 A.H., corresponding to 19 April 1998 A.D., to discuss the comments made about the exposure draft. The Committee made the necessary amend- ments which it deemed necessary in light of the discussions that took place in the two listening sessions. The revised exposure draft was reviewed and approved by the Shari\u2019a Committee in its meeting No. (8) which was held on 18-19 Muharram 1419 A.H., corresponding to 14-15 May 1998 A.D., after making some changes to the draft. The Accounting and Auditing Standards Board adopted the proposed standard in its meeting No. (15) held on 27-28 Safar 1419 A.H., corresponding to 21-22 June 1998 A.D.",

If a date is fixed, then the contract turns into Salam because this is a characteristic of a binding contract such as Salam, but not Istisna\u2019a which is open for options. b) Abu Yusuf and Muhammad Ibn Al-Hasan Al-Shaybani, the companions of Abu Hanifah, accepted the condition of fixing a specific future delivery date on the ground that people have been practicing Istisna\u2019a in that manner. c) However, Abu Hanifah and his two companions have agreed that in an Istisna\u2019a contract if a delivery date is fixed and it is not in line with what is commonly practised, then the Istisna\u2019a contract turns into a Salam contract. This standard accommodates the opinion of the two com- panions of Abu Hanifah who permit fixing a future delivery date. Therefore, fixing a future delivery date is a necessity. This is in line with both the ruling of the Committee of \u201cMa- jallat Al-Ahkam Al-\u2019Adliyyah\u201d, which stipulates that Istisna\u2019a is a binding contract, and the resolution of the Islamic Fiqh Academy. This is based on for the following: a) Al-Masnoo\u2019 is a product that should either be manufactured or obtained from the market. Therefore, fixing a future de- livery date becomes a necessity in order to remove Gharar (uncertainty). b) The future delivery date depends, on one hand, on the mutual agreement between the two parties involved and on the other hand, on the time required by Al-Sani\u2019 to manufacture Al- Masnoo\u2019 and/or to obtain Al-Masnoo\u2019 from other parties according to the contract. c) In Istisna\u2019a contract, fixing a future delivery date is allowed when the need and necessity arise irrespective to whether or not it is commonly practised by people.",

According to this method, a por- tion of Istisna\u2019a profit commensurate with the work completed during a period is recognized at the end of the period as a realized profit. That is, Istisna\u2019a profit is allocated over the periods in which the contract is being executed in proportion to the work completed in each period. A crucial condition for applying this method is that the expected cost of completing the contract is estimated with reasonable accuracy.

            "content": "According to this method, the entire contract costs and revenues of Istisna\u2019a contract are recognized at the end of the financial period during which the contract is completed.\nThe first alternative; i.e., percentage of completion method, was chosen for the recognition of Istisna\u2019a and parallel Istisna\u2019a profit, provided that the contract costs can be estimated with reasonable accuracy. However, if the contract costs cannot be estimated with reasonable accuracy, the completed contract method should be used.\nThe percentage of completion method is preferred because it provides for a better matching of Istisna\u2019a revenues and expenses. Furthermore, it reflects in a more accurate manner the outcome of the earning activities of Al-Sani\u2019 (the Islamic bank) over the entire time period of contract execution, thereby presenting more relevant information to users of the financial statements.\nFurthermore, the percentage of completion method enables investment accountholders to participate in Istisna\u2019a profit as long as they have a contractual relationship with the Islamic bank. However, postponing the recognition of revenue and profits until the contract is completed (i.e., using the completed contract method) denies investment accountholders from their share in Istisna\u2019a profits should they withdraw their funds before the contract is completed. Therefore, the second alternative (the completed contract method) should be applied only in unusual circumstances, i.e., when the first alternative (the percentage of completion method) is not applicable.",

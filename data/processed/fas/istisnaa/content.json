Each partner has the option to rescind the contract before it is implemented. Al-Sani\u2019 has the right not to commence manufacturing the goods, while Al-Mustasni\u2019 has the right to withdraw from buying Al-Masnoo\u2019. If Al-Sani\u2019 manufactured Al-Masnoo\u2019, he would not be obliged to deliver it to Al-Mustasni\u2019. Rather, he has the option to dispense with it in the way he deems fit. This is because the contract is not for the manufactured goods themselves, but for Al-Masnoo\u2019 of certain specifications. Al-Mustasni\u2019 also has the option to accept Al-Masnoo\u2019. The Hanafis have three different views if Al-Sani\u2019 manufactured Al-Masnoo\u2019 according to the specifications and decided to deliver it to Al-Mustasni\u2019 in fulfillment of his contractual obligations. These are: a) The preponderant view is that the contract becomes binding on Al-Sani\u2019 who has waived his option by delivering Al-Masnoo\u2019. Yet, the buyer\u2019s option remains to be exercised. This view is attributed to the three Imams: Abu Hanifah, Abu Yusuf, and Muhammad. b) Abu Hanifah is also reported to have said that even at this stage Al-Sani\u2019 retains his right on an equal footing with Al-Mustasni\u2019. c) Abu Yusuf is also reported to have expressed a second opinion to the effect that in this situation the contract becomes binding on the two parties.",

The commentator on the text says: Istisna\u2019a is a contract of sale and not a mere promise. Once it is constituted, no party, according to Abu Yousuf\u2019s point of view, has the right to withdraw unless the consent of the other party is secured. Accordingly, Al-Sani\u2019 has to deliver Al-Masnoo\u2019.",

These are the Jordanian, Yemeni and Sudanese laws of civil transactions as well as the Unified Arab Law proposed by the League of Arab Countries.",

It is on this reality that the 'Majallat Al-Ahkam Al-\u2019Adliyyah', modern civil Islamic legislations and the Islamic Fiqh Academy developed their viewpoint, which is consistent with Shari\u2019a rules and principles.",

This is because Istisna\u2019a is a binding contract. This is the view adopted by recent civil Islamic legislations, and modern transactions, whereby both the transfer of title of ownership is automatic and unconditional and Al-Sani\u2019 is entitled to the agreed upon amount once the contract is constituted.",

This new contract is known as parallel Istisna\u2019a, which is in essence a subcontract whereby the obligation of Al-Sani\u2019 in the first contract are carried out. Nevertheless: a) The Islamic bank as Al-Sani\u2019 in the first contract will remain solely responsible for the execution of his obligations as if the parallel contract is nonexistent. Hence, Al-Sani\u2019 in the first contract would remain liable for any default, negligence or breach of contract ensuing from the parallel contract. b) Al-Sani\u2019 in the parallel Istisna\u2019a is accountable to Al-Mustasni\u2019 (the Islamic bank) in the way and manner by which he performs his obligations. He has no direct legal relationship with Al-Mustasni\u2019 in the first contract. The second Istisna\u2019a is a parallel contract, but not a contingent transaction on the first contract. Legally speaking they are different contracts with respect to the rights and obligations. c) The Islamic bank as Al-Sani\u2019 is liable to Al-Mustasni\u2019 with regard to any mal-execution of the subcontractor and any guarantees arising therefrom. It is this very liability that justifies the validity of the parallel Istisna\u2019a and which also justifies the charging of profit by the Islamic bank, if any.",

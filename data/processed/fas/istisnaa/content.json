After taking into consideration the replies from the Islamic banks, the Accounting and Auditing Standards Board decided in its meeting No. (10) held on 14-16 Ramadan 1416 A.H., corresponding to 3-5 February 1996 A.D., in Jeddah, Kingdom of Saudi Arabia, to give priority to the preparation of a standard on Istisna\u2019a and parallel Istisna\u2019a. On 1 Dhul-Qa\u2019dah 1417 A.H., corresponding to 10 March 1997 A.D., two consultants were commissioned to prepare the preliminary studies on the juristic and accounting aspects of the standard. These studies were dis- cussed in the Accounting Standards Committee meeting No. (11), held on 7 Safar 1418 A.H., corresponding to 12 June 1997 A.D., in Bahrain. The revised juristic and accounting studies as well as an exposure draft of the standard were discussed by the Committee in its meeting No. (12) held during the period of 13-14 Jumada I, 1418 A.H., corresponding to 14-15 September 1997 A.D., in Bahrain. In its meeting No. (13) held during the period of 12-13 Jumada II, 1418 A.H., corresponding to 13-14 October 1997 A.D., in Doha, the Committee reviewed and discussed the revised exposure draft of the standard and necessary amendments were made in light of the discussions that took place and the comments made by the members. The exposure draft was submitted to the Shari\u2019a Committee in its meeting No. (8), held on 13-15 Rajab, 1418 AH., corresponding to 13-15 November, 1997 A.D., in Bahrain, and the amendments which it deemed necessary were made. The amended exposure draft was discussed in the Standards Board meeting No. (14) held on 11-12 Ramadan 1418 A.H., corresponding to 10-11 January 1998 A.D., in Jeddah, Kingdom of Saudi Arabia. The Standards Board made further amendments to the exposure draft and decided that it should be distributed to specialists and interested parties to obtain their comments on the exposure draft in order to discuss them in a listening session. Two listening sessions were held, one in Pakistan on 18 Dhul-Hajjah 1418 A.H., corresponding to 15 April 1998 A.D., and the other in Bahrain on 22 Dhul-Hajjah 1418 A.H., corresponding to 19 April 1998 A.D. The listening session s were attended by more than 230 participants representing central banks, Islamic banks, accounting firms, Shari\u2019a scholars, academics and others who are interested in this field. Members of the Accounting Standards Committee responded in the listening sessions as well as the oral comments that were expressed in the sessions of the listening sessions.s. The Accounting Standards Committee held a meeting on 22 Dhul-Hajjah 1418 A.H., corresponding to 19 April 1998 A.D., to discuss the comments made about the exposure draft. The Committee made the necessary amend- ments which it deemed necessary in light of the discussions that took place in the two listening sessions. The revised exposure draft was reviewed and approved by the Shari\u2019a Committee in its meeting No. (8) which was held on 18-19 Muharram 1419 A.H., corresponding to 14-15 May 1998 A.D., after making some changes to the draft.

The accounting treatments by the Islamic banks of Istisna\u2019a and parallel Istisna\u2019a give rise to numerous problems due to the multiplicity of alternatives available for the treatment of many issues. Among the issues that are susceptible to significant differences in the accounting treatment are: \u25a0 \u25a0 Measurement and recognition of the costs of Istisna\u2019a and parallel Istisna\u2019a Measurement and recognition of the costs of Istisna\u2019a and parallel Istisna\u2019a contracts. \u25a0 \u25a0 Measurement and recognition of the revenues and profits of Istisna\u2019a Measurement and recognition of the revenues and profits of Istisna\u2019a and parallel Istisna\u2019a contracts. \u25a0 \u25a0 Valuation of Istisna\u2019a assets at the end of a financial period, especially Valuation of Istisna\u2019a assets at the end of a financial period, especially when contract losses are expected. \u25a0 \u25a0 Measurement and treatment of contract maintenance and warranty Measurement and treatment of contract maintenance and warranty costs. \u25a0 \u25a0 Scope and mode of disclosure of accounting information and policies Scope and mode of disclosure of accounting information and policies relating to Istisna\u2019a and parallel Istisna\u2019a transactions in the financial statements of the Islamic bank. Differences in the accounting treatments of such issues and their disclosure in the financial statements of the Islamic bank are expected to have adverse effects on the comparability of accounting information presented in the financial statements of Islamic banks. Thus, the standardisation of accounting treatments of Istisna\u2019a and parallel Istisna\u2019a transactions on bases consistent with Statement of Financial Accounting No. (1): Objectives of Financial Accounting for Islamic Banks and Financial Institutions (Statement of Objectives), and the Statement of Financial Accounting No. (2): Concepts of Financial Accounting for Islamic Banks and Financial Institutions (Statement of Concepts) is necessary in order to provide useful information to users of the financial reports of these banks and for ensuring comparability of such information.",

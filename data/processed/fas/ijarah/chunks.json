Revision of FAS 8 \u201cIjarah and Ijarah Muntahia Bittamleek\u201d was already on agenda of the earlier board, and a limited scope revision was already under discussion at the accounting standards committee. However, considering the expected changes, at that time, in the generally accepted accounting principles with regard to lease accounting1, it was decided that the standard revision shall be made duly considering the principal changes in accounting by the global accounting standard setters.\nThe board was also mindful of the fact that eliminating or reducing the financial reporting requirements with regard to any demonstrable differences between Ijarah and Ijarah MBT against conventional leases will jeopardize the sanctity of the transaction\u2019s financial reporting and may also adversely impact the reputation of the Islamic finance industry.\nA review of FAS 8 \u201cIjarah and Ijarah Muntahia Bittamleek\u201d and preliminary study on the topic duly considering the above factors identified that there were needs for improvement in the same in line with the changes in the industry and the global best practices of accounting. Certain observations and comments of certain terminology and approaches used in the said standard were noted from the Shari'ah perspective as well. Accordingly, the board decided to issue a revised standard on the subject of Ijarah."

It was also noted that a limited scope revision project for FAS 8 had already been initiated by the predecessor board. FAS 8 originally issued in 1997 catered and responded to the need to distinguish a Shari\u2019ah compliant lease from a conventional lease and to prescribe the correct accounting treatments in line with its true nature in line with Shari\u2019ah. However, considering the fact that there had been significant evolution of the product and its new and innovative variants had become more common, it was eminent to review and revise the standard duly catering to such needs. Accordingly, the oard decided that there is a need to improve the existing FAS 8."

Whether or not this standard shall include service Ijarah in its scope was a key question addressed by the working group as well as the board, and was raised during public hearing sessions as well. The board considered that the service Ijarah can be segregated into two types, being human based or technology and equipment based such as, bandwidth, telecommunication minutes etc. Considering the significant differences in nature of the two types of Ijarah, the board decided that this standard shall cover the asset Ijarah only. However, the service Ijarah which involves equipment as well, the same shall be subject to this standard as such contracts will have an Ijarah element subject to the requirements of this standard. For such type of transactions, the measurement of usufruct can be performed by unit of output or other such measures."

Whereas, in a finance lease, according to its definition, substantially all risk and rewards incidental to ownership are transferred to the lessee at inception of lease i.e. in substance it is considered to be a sale. It is worth noting that if substantially all risk and rewards in a lease transaction are transferred at inception, the same cannot be termed as Shari\u2019ah compliant.

This is the reason that the conventional accounting standards focus on recognition of liability, as the primary requirement. The board also took a considered view that the concept of minimum lease payment cannot be applied in line with Shari'ah principles. In Ijarah the \u2018gross Ijarah liability\u2019 comprise of the total Ijarah rentals and not total lease payments. In other words, total lease payments under conventional accounting standards include guaranteed residual value and other advanced initial deposits etc. which is not acceptable for Ijarah, duly considering the Ijarah and sale / gift as separate transactions."

Certain key distinguishing factors are listed below: a. in Ijarah MBT, during the lease term, the lessor carries the operational risks related to ownership e.g. theft, destruction, technical obsolescence, unavailability for a period due to major maintenance / repairs etc., as well as, the Takaful / insurance cost and taxes related to ownership of asset; b. in Ijarah MBT, during the lease term, the lessor carries the market risk related to the ownership of the asset i.e. if for any reason the promise is not executed at the future date, the gain or loss in value of asset relates to the lessor; c. in Ijarah MBT, the rentals commence from the time the asset is delivered to the lessee in condition good enough for intended use, and not from the time when the funds are disbursed; d. in Ijarah MBT, no rental is chargeable during the period when asset is not available for the intended use for any reason; and"

The board also considered the philosophical foundations of Islamic finance. The fundamentals are based on the prohibition of Riba and permission of trade which means that the time value of money is not acceptable, but the time value of economic resources such as goods, assets, labour and entrepreneurship is acceptable. Accordingly, the board took a considered view that in Ijarah MBT, the price (Ijarah rental) is calculated and charged on the use benefit of asset rather than time value of money (i.e. disbursed financing). As an example, Ijarah rental cannot be charged and recorded until the underlying asset is in possession of the lessee or if the asset is not available for intended use for any reason. In conventional finance lease, on the contrary, the lessor normally commences charging and recording interest on the day financing is disbursed even if the asset is not in existence or in possession."

Additionally, the lessee has an obligation to return the underlying asset to the lessor at the end of the Ijarah term. The lessor has a right to receive payments from the lessee for providing the right to use the underlying asset. The lessor also retains rights associated with ownership of the underlying asset.

The board, in particular, noted that as per Shari\u2019ah, Ijarah rental can only be charged after possession of asset (in usable condition) to the lessee and rental is neither earned nor recorded before possession and delivery of asset (irrespective of the pricing mechanism involved, which may take into consideration such period), and this is one of the distinguishing factor between Ijarah MBT and conventional finance leases. The similar issue in related to future Ijarah i.e. Ijarah Mawsufah fi al-Dhimma was also raised and discussed during the public hearings and was duly considered by the board. However, after due deliberations, it was decided that any Ijarah rentals charged and / or received before the commencement date shall be recorded as an advance which shall remain non- remunerative."

However, there were situations where certain institutions were using annuity method for depreciation. The board considered if there needs to be change to the depreciation method to allow annuity method as this was further raised during the public hearings of the standard. After due deliberations the board concluded that the annuity method of accounting was not suitable as it does not reflect the pattern of economic benefits, as well as, is against the essence of Shari'ah."

This was based on the fact that in certain situations the use of effective rate of return method for recognition of revenue might result in more equitable and fair distribution of profits amongst stakeholders."

As per Shari\u2019ah these are a receivable of the lessee and payable of the lessor and shall continue to be accounted for until the conclusion of the Ijarah term. After conclusion of the Ijarah term the same can be used as a sale transaction proceed or be refunded, as per the mutual arrangement between the parties."

The assessment of probability of exercising the extension is also in line with global best practices. There is a rebuttable presumption that expressed intention of the lessee to exercise the extension option(s) provides reasonable certainty with regard to extension of Ijarah term in line with generally accepted accounting principles. Subsequent reassessment is also in line with generally accepted accounting principles."

The members agreed that an accounting working group should be formed immediately to that effect."

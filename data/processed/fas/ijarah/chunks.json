It was also noted that a limited scope revision project for FAS 8 had already been initiated by the predecessor board. FAS 8 originally issued in 1997 catered and responded to the need to distinguish a Shari\u2019ah compliant lease from a conventional lease and to prescribe the correct accounting treatments in line with its true nature in line with Shari\u2019ah. However, considering the fact that there had been significant evolution of the product and its new and innovative variants had become more common, it was eminent to review and revise the standard duly catering to such needs. Accordingly, the oard decided that there is a need to improve the existing FAS 8."

Whether or not this standard shall include service Ijarah in its scope was a key question addressed by the working group as well as the board, and was raised during public hearing sessions as well. The board considered that the service Ijarah can be segregated into two types, being human based or technology and equipment based such as, bandwidth, telecommunication minutes etc. Considering the significant differences in nature of the two types of Ijarah, the board decided that this standard shall cover the asset Ijarah only. However, the service Ijarah which involves equipment as well, the same shall be subject to this standard as such contracts will have an Ijarah element subject to the requirements of this standard. For such type of transactions, the measurement of usufruct can be performed by unit of output or other such measures."

Certain key distinguishing factors are listed below: a. in Ijarah MBT, during the lease term, the lessor carries the operational risks related to ownership e.g. theft, destruction, technical obsolescence, unavailability for a period due to major maintenance / repairs etc., as well as, the Takaful / insurance cost and taxes related to ownership of asset; b. in Ijarah MBT, during the lease term, the lessor carries the market risk related to the ownership of the asset i.e. if for any reason the promise is not executed at the future date, the gain or loss in value of asset relates to the lessor; c. in Ijarah MBT, the rentals commence from the time the asset is delivered to the lessee in condition good enough for intended use, and not from the time when the funds are disbursed; d. in Ijarah MBT, no rental is chargeable during the period when asset is not available for the intended use for any reason; and e. in Ijarah MBT the ownership transfer takes place against a unilateral promise which is not binding on either of the parties and there are situations when such transfer never takes place e.g. destruction or theft of the asset before completion of Ijarah term."

Additionally, the lessee has an obligation to return the underlying asset to the lessor at the end of the Ijarah term. The lessor has a right to receive payments from the lessee for providing the right to use the underlying asset. The lessor also retains rights associated with ownership of the underlying asset.

The board initially considered the proposal, but considering the specific nature of an Ijarah right-of-use asset, took a considered view that it might not be the right approach to allow fair valuation for an asset which has a limited life and which does not reflect the underlying asset, but only the right-of-use of the same. This was also reaffirmed after discussions on the public hearing comments and the working group comments of the same."

        "content": "AAOIFI Financial Accounting Standard 32: Ijarah > Appendix B: Basis for conclusions > Ijarah MBT through gradual transfer / Diminishing Musharaka Ijarah\n\nThe Board after taking into account industry comments agreed that the accounting for Ijarah MBT through gradual transfer under FAS 8 was having practical impediments and required improvement. In order to avoid the complexities of accounting for Ijarah MBT with gradual transfer, the standard introduces the underlying asset to be termed as a \u2018combined asset\u2019 which includes the proportionate underlying asset as well as the right-of-use asset owned by the lessee. It is also considered that if the units are sold at cost (to lessee) depreciation at the end by the lessor is not required, as the residual value is equal to the cost. This shall significantly reduce the accounting complications. The board also considered that there are transactions in different parts of the world which are very similar in characteristics to Ijarah MBT with gradual transfer of ownership, such as \u2018Diminishing Musharaka based on Shirkat-ul-Milk with Ijarah\u2019. The board decided that all such products shall be subject to the same accounting and reporting requirements under this standard."

The board, in particular, noted that as per Shari\u2019ah, Ijarah rental can only be charged after possession of asset (in usable condition) to the lessee and rental is neither earned nor recorded before possession and delivery of asset (irrespective of the pricing mechanism involved, which may take into consideration such period), and this is one of the distinguishing factor between Ijarah MBT and conventional finance leases. The similar issue in related to future Ijarah i.e. Ijarah Mawsufah fi al-Dhimma was also raised and discussed during the public hearings and was duly considered by the board. However, after due deliberations, it was decided that any Ijarah rentals charged and / or received before the commencement date shall be recorded as an advance which shall remain non- remunerative."

As per Shari\u2019ah these are a receivable of the lessee and payable of the lessor and shall continue to be accounted for until the conclusion of the Ijarah term. After conclusion of the Ijarah term the same can be used as a sale transaction proceed or be refunded, as per the mutual arrangement between the parties."

The assessment of probability of exercising the extension is also in line with global best practices. There is a rebuttable presumption that expressed intention of the lessee to exercise the extension option(s) provides reasonable certainty with regard to extension of Ijarah term in line with generally accepted accounting principles. Subsequent reassessment is also in line with generally accepted accounting principles."

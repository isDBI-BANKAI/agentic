Revision of FAS 8 'Ijarah and Ijarah Muntahia Bittamleek' was already on agenda of the earlier board, and a limited scope revision was already under discussion at the accounting standards committee. However, considering the expected changes, at that time, in the generally accepted accounting principles with regard to lease accounting, it was decided that the standard revision shall be made duly considering the principal changes in accounting by the global accounting standard setters. The board was also mindful of the fact that eliminating or reducing the financial reporting requirements with regard to any demonstrable differences between Ijarah and Ijarah MBT against conventional leases will jeopardize the sanctity of the transaction\u2019s financial reporting and may also adversely impact the reputation of the Islamic finance industry. A review of FAS 8 'Ijarah and Ijarah Muntahia Bittamleek' and preliminary study on the topic duly considering the above factors identified that there were needs for improvement in the same in line with the changes in the industry and the global best practices of accounting. Certain observations and comments of certain terminology and approaches used in the said standard were noted from the Shari'ah perspective as well. Accordingly, the board decided to issue a revised standard on the subject of Ijarah.",

FAS 8 requirements of recording monthly depreciation and gain and loss for such transactions are done away with; e. allowing effective rate of return/profit rate method for accounting for rental income, in the hand of the lessor; f. testing for impairment of right-of-use asset shall be subject to requirements of FAS 30 'Impairment, Credit Losses and Onerous Commitments'; and g. detailed guidelines are provided for presentation and disclosures with enhanced disclosure by lessor and lessee of information as compared to previous requirements in FAS 8.",

It was also noted that a limited scope revision project for FAS 8 had already been initiated by the predecessor board. FAS 8 originally issued in 1997 catered and responded to the need to distinguish a Shari\u2019ah compliant lease from a conventional lease and to prescribe the correct accounting treatments in line with its true nature in line with Shari\u2019ah. However, considering the fact that there had been significant evolution of the product and its new and innovative variants had become more common, it was eminent to review and revise the standard duly catering to such needs.

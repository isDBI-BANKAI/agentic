It was also noted that a limited scope revision project for FAS 8 had already been initiated by the predecessor board. FAS 8 originally issued in 1997 catered and responded to the need to distinguish a Shari\u2019ah compliant lease from a conventional lease and to prescribe the correct accounting treatments in line with its true nature in line with Shari\u2019ah. However, considering the fact that there had been significant evolution of the product and its new and innovative variants had become more common, it was eminent to review and revise the standard duly catering to such needs.

However, the service Ijarah which involves equipment as well, the same shall be subject to this standard as such contracts will have an Ijarah element subject to the requirements of this standard.

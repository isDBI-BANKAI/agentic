However, considering the expected changes, at that time, in the generally accepted accounting principles with regard to lease accounting1, it was decided that the standard revision shall be made duly considering the principal changes in accounting by the global accounting standard setters.\nThe board was also mindful of the fact that eliminating or reducing the financial reporting requirements with regard to any demonstrable differences between Ijarah and Ijarah MBT against conventional leases will jeopardize the sanctity of the transaction\u2019s financial reporting and may also adversely impact the reputation of the Islamic finance industry.\nA review of FAS 8 \u201cIjarah and Ijarah Muntahia Bittamleek\u201d and preliminary study on the topic duly considering the above factors identified that there were needs for improvement in the same in line with the changes in the industry and the global best practices of accounting.

It was also noted that a limited scope revision project for FAS 8 had already been initiated by the predecessor board. FAS 8 originally issued in 1997 catered and responded to the need to distinguish a Shari\u2019ah compliant lease from a conventional lease and to prescribe the correct accounting treatments in line with its true nature in line with Shari\u2019ah. However, considering the fact that there had been significant evolution of the product and its new and innovative variants had become more common, it was eminent to review and revise the standard duly catering to such needs.

It is worth noting that if substantially all risk and rewards in a lease transaction are transferred at inception, the same cannot be termed as Shari\u2019ah compliant.

The board also considered the philosophical foundations of Islamic finance. The fundamentals are based on the prohibition of Riba and permission of trade which means that the time value of money is not acceptable, but the time value of economic resources such as goods, assets, labour and entrepreneurship is acceptable. Accordingly, the board took a considered view that in Ijarah MBT, the price (Ijarah rental) is calculated and charged on the use benefit of asset rather than time value of money (i.e. disbursed financing). As an example, Ijarah rental cannot be charged and recorded until the underlying asset is in possession of the lessee or if the asset is not available for intended use for any reason. In conventional finance lease, on the contrary, the lessor normally commences charging and recording interest on the day financing is disbursed even if the asset is not in existence or in possession.",

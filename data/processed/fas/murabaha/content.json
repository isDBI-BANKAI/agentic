The board was of the view that since these are to be sold in the normal course of business hence the entity specific NRV is the appropriate accounting treatment in case of a decline in value against cost. It was also considered that if a credit-worthy customer has provided a promise to purchase at a price which is cost plus profit, then a downward adjustment for NRV is not needed, even if the market value of the inventory has declined, because technically the NRV for the institution is above the cost.",

Additionally, the board also apprised that although it is not obligatory to give discount in case of early payment, but it is permissible (though not as a common practice) and at times customary (including because of regulatory requirements, or because of view of certain scholars) to give a discretionary discount, hence it would be more prudent if the profit is amortized over the credit period.",

The board further concluded that reporting the same as a contra asset would reflect better presentation as all the relevant amounts shall be presented at the same place (note) in the financial statements.",

Instead, the board decided that the time proportionate allocation is the most suitable method to achieve the objectives of fair, just, equitable and prudent profit sharing amongst stakeholders. The board further discussed the suitable approach to apply the time proportionate method and after due deliberations, decided that the effective rate of return method shall be the best approach to apply the time proportionate basis of profit allocation, particularly for long term transactions, and that this method will provide better matching to the return on investment account holders funds. The board decided that there is no Shari\u2019ah objection on the same because it is merely a method of allocation of profits (which are already earned) over a period to provide just, fair and equitable return to the stakeholders.",

In addition, they suggested that it will avoid 'over-pricing' of the assets in the hand of the buyer. The board considered and evaluated the matter and also consulted certain Shari\u2019ah scholars on this matter and concluded that the justifications available for deferment of the profit in the hand of the seller i.e. (i) fair, just and equitable distribution of profits amongst stakeholders; and (ii) prudence, are not available in this case hence it may not be concluded that there is no Shari\u2019ah issue in the mirror accounting. Additionally, the board considered that the matter of over-pricing can be catered through the suggested approaches of impairment and NRV testing etc. This view was confirmed by the committee of Shari\u2019ah board for review of accounting, auditing, governance and ethics standards.",

As a part of such process and based on time-to-time feedback received from the market participants, as well as, the changes and updates in the generally accepted accounting principles set out by other standards setting bodies, it was considered imperative to perform a comprehensive review and revision of the existing standards on Murabaha and deferred payment sales.

After due consideration, the board decided that the key principles for all deferred payment sales transactions including Murabaha from the economic substance point of view remain the same and accordingly, similar accounting treatment shall be followed insofar a deviation is not required by Shari\u2019ah or by the structure of the transaction (like for example in case of a Murabaha by making the profit and cost known, which may change a few minor treatments). This however shall not include Tawarruq and commodity Murabaha transactions which were scoped out (see BC1 \u2013 BC3). Accordingly, the board decided that the revised standard shall include Murabaha and other deferred payment sales transactions and shall supersede the existing FAS 2 and FAS 20.",

While previously no FAS was using the term inventory to describe the underlying assets for trading transactions, the board decided that in order to depict the true nature of such assets held for sale, and to bring the accounting treatments closer to the generally accepted accounting principles it would be more appropriate to describe them as inventory.",

After due deliberations, the board decided it would be more appropriate to record the inventories at the lower of cost and net realizable value (NRV) term to keep it close to the generally accepted accounting principles. The board was of the view that since these are to be sold in the normal course of business hence the entity specific NRV is the appropriate accounting treatment in case of a decline in value against cost. It was also considered that if a credit-worthy customer has provided a promise to purchase at a price which is cost plus profit, then a downward adjustment for NRV is not needed, even if the market value of the inventory has declined, because technically the NRV for the institution is above the cost.",

The board discussed this issue at length including the definition of revenue and decided that the gross increase of in assets resulting from trading activities shall be considered as revenue of the institution. Similarly, the board decided that de-recognition of inventory (along with other relevant expenses) shall be considered as cost of sales for the institution.

Additionally, the board also apprised that although it is not obligatory to give discount in case of early payment, but it is permissible (though not as a common practice) and at times customary (including because of regulatory requirements, or because of view of certain scholars) to give a discretionary discount, hence it would be more prudent if the profit is amortized over the credit period.",

The board further discussed the suitable approach to apply the time proportionate method and after due deliberations, decided that the effective rate of return method shall be the best approach to apply the time proportionate basis of profit allocation, particularly for long term transactions, and that this method will provide better matching to the return on investment account holders funds.

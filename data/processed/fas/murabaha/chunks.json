As a part of such process and based on time-to-time feedback received from the market participants, as well as, the changes and updates in the generally accepted accounting principles set out by other standards setting bodies, it was considered imperative to perform a comprehensive review and revision of the existing standards on Murabaha and deferred payment sales. Additionally, the earlier standards did not address the issue of accounting for the purchaser in Murabaha and deferred payment sales transactions."

This however shall not include Tawarruq and commodity Murabaha transactions which were scoped out (see BC1 \u2013 BC3). Accordingly, the board decided that the revised standard shall include Murabaha and other deferred payment sales transactions and shall supersede the existing FAS 2 and FAS 20."

While previously no FAS was using the term inventory to describe the underlying assets for trading transactions, the board decided that in order to depict the true nature of such assets held for sale, and to bring the accounting treatments closer to the generally accepted accounting principles it would be more appropriate to describe them as inventory."

After due deliberations, the board decided it would be more appropriate to record the inventories at the lower of cost and net realizable value (NRV) term to keep it close to the generally accepted accounting principles. The board was of the view that since these are to be sold in the normal course of business hence the entity specific NRV is the appropriate accounting treatment in case of a decline in value against cost. It was also considered that if a credit-worthy customer has provided a promise to purchase at a price which is cost plus profit, then a downward adjustment for NRV is not needed, even if the market value of the inventory has declined, because technically the NRV for the institution is above the cost."

The board discussed this issue at length including the definition of revenue and decided that the gross increase of in assets resulting from trading activities shall be considered as revenue of the institution. Similarly, the board decided that de-recognition of inventory (along with other relevant expenses) shall be considered as cost of sales for the institution. That being said, the board decided to continue the accounting for deferment and recording of profits in the books of the seller for transactions involving a credit."

The board concluded that the amount of Dain is necessary to be disclosed for several reasons primarily driven by Shari\u2019ah including determination of Zakah, determination of transferability of an asset or a pool of assets, determination of tradability of the shares of the institution and to disclose the full legal right of the institution against the debtor."

The board apprised that while a few may argue that the ideal treatment is to recognize the profit upfront because it is a profit and a receivable from Shari\u2019ah perspective, yet, it would not be fair and equitable, and at time prudent, to record whole amount of profits upfront."

Additionally, the board also apprised that although it is not obligatory to give discount in case of early payment, but it is permissible (though not as a common practice) and at times customary (including because of regulatory requirements, or because of view of certain scholars) to give a discretionary discount, hence it would be more prudent if the profit is amortized over the credit period."

Accordingly, the deferred profit is not considered a liability of the institution and is treated more like a reserve (which is earned from Shari\u2019ah perspective, but not necessarily taken to income for distribution purposes, for the want of fairness, justice, equity and prudence). The board further concluded that reporting the same as a contra asset would reflect better presentation as all the relevant amounts shall be presented at the same place (note) in the financial statements."

Instead, the board decided that the time proportionate allocation is the most suitable method to achieve the objectives of fair, just, equitable and prudent profit sharing amongst stakeholders. The board further discussed the suitable approach to apply the time proportionate method and after due deliberations, decided that the effective rate of return method shall be the best approach to apply the time proportionate basis of profit allocation, particularly for long term transactions, and that this method will provide better matching to the return on investment account holders funds. The board decided that there is no Shari\u2019ah objection on the same because it is merely a method of allocation of profits (which are already earned) over a period to provide just, fair and equitable return to the stakeholders."

In addition, they suggested that it will avoid \u201cover-pricing\u201d of the assets in the hand of the buyer. The board considered and evaluated the matter and also consulted certain Shari\u2019ah scholars on this matter and concluded that the justifications available for deferment of the profit in the hand of the seller i.e. (i) fair, just and equitable distribution of profits amongst stakeholders; and (ii) prudence, are not available in this case hence it may not be concluded that there is no Shari\u2019ah issue in the mirror accounting. Additionally, the board considered that the matter of over-pricing can be catered through the suggested approaches of impairment and NRV testing etc. This view was confirmed by the committee of Shari\u2019ah board for review of accounting, auditing, governance and ethics standards."

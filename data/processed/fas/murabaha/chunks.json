As a part of such process and based on time-to-time feedback received from the market participants, as well as, the changes and updates in the generally accepted accounting principles set out by other standards setting bodies, it was considered imperative to perform a comprehensive review and revision of the existing standards on Murabaha and deferred payment sales. Additionally, the earlier standards did not address the issue of accounting for the purchaser in Murabaha and deferred payment sales transactions."

After due deliberations, the board decided it would be more appropriate to record the inventories at the lower of cost and net realizable value (NRV) term to keep it close to the generally accepted accounting principles. The board was of the view that since these are to be sold in the normal course of business hence the entity specific NRV is the appropriate accounting treatment in case of a decline in value against cost. It was also considered that if a credit-worthy customer has provided a promise to purchase at a price which is cost plus profit, then a downward adjustment for NRV is not needed, even if the market value of the inventory has declined, because technically the NRV for the institution is above the cost."

Additionally, the board also apprised that although it is not obligatory to give discount in case of early payment, but it is permissible (though not as a common practice) and at times customary (including because of regulatory requirements, or because of view of certain scholars) to give a discretionary discount, hence it would be more prudent if the profit is amortized over the credit period."

Instead, the board decided that the time proportionate allocation is the most suitable method to achieve the objectives of fair, just, equitable and prudent profit sharing amongst stakeholders. The board further discussed the suitable approach to apply the time proportionate method and after due deliberations, decided that the effective rate of return method shall be the best approach to apply the time proportionate basis of profit allocation, particularly for long term transactions, and that this method will provide better matching to the return on investment account holders funds. The board decided that there is no Shari\u2019ah objection on the same because it is merely a method of allocation of profits (which are already earned) over a period to provide just, fair and equitable return to the stakeholders."

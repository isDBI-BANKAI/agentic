The word (Institution/Institutions) is used here to refer, in short, to Islamic financial institutions including Islamic Banks."

Scope of the Standard\n\nThis standard covers the Murabahah transaction and its various stages, the issues relating to guarantees before concluding a Murabahah deal such as promise, Hamish Jiddiyyah (security deposit) and issues relating to guarantees for recovery of the debt created by the Murabahah transaction. This standard does not cover deferred payment sales that take place on a basis other than that of Murabahah. It also does not cover other trust and bargaining sales."

It is permissible to prepare a single set of documentation to be signed by the customer and to include both the customer\u2019s stated wish that the Institution should buy the item from the supplier and a promise to buy the item from the Institution. It is permissible for the customer to prepare such a document, or it may be a standard application form prepared by the Institution to be signed by the customer."

In the latter case, the statement is considered as an invitation to negotiate, and not as an offer of sale. It is preferable that the invoice should be addressed to the Institution so as to include an offer of sale from the supplier effective up to the end of a specified period. The contract of sale is deemed concluded once acceptance comes from the Institution."

Nor may the party that is supplying the item be wholly, or by way of majority [more than 50%], owned by the customer. If a sale transaction takes place and later on it is discovered that it was carried out through such practices, this would render the transaction void as it is tantamount to \u2019Inah."

The banking Murabahah involves deferred payment terms, but such deferred payment is not one of the essential conditions of such transaction, as there is also a Murabahah arranged with no deferral of payment. In this case, the seller only receives a mark-up that only includes the profit for a spot sale and not the extra charge it would, otherwise, receive for deferral of payment."

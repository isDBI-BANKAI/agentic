This means that the item must move from the responsibility of the supplier to the responsibility of the Institution. Similarly, it is obligatory that the point when the risk of the item is passed on by the Institution to the customer be clearly identified, with reference to the stages in which the item is transferred from one party to another."

Taking possession may be actual in the case of the physical delivery or transportation to the acquirer or its agent, but may also take place constructively by placing of the item at the acquirer\u2019s disposal so as to enable him to deal with it at his will, even though no physical delivery has taken place. Taking possession of an item of real property may also take place by means of the property being vacated and its being placed at the acquirer\u2019s disposal; if the latter is not able to have disposal of the purchased item, then the vacation of the property is not considered as conveying possession. In the case of moveable assets, possession will take place in accordance with the nature of the asset."

On Tuesday 13 Dhul-Hajjah 1419 A.H., corresponding to 30 March 1999 A.D., the Fatwa and Arbitration Committee recommended to the Shari\u2019ah Board the commissioning of a Shari\u2019ah consultant to prepare a juristic study and an exposure draft of the Shari\u2019ah Rules for Murabahah. In its meeting held on 13-14 Rajab 1420 A.H., corresponding to 22- 23 October 1999 A.D., the Fatwa and Arbitration Committee discussed the exposure draft of the Shari\u2019ah Rules for Murabahah, and asked the consultant to make the amendments in light of the comments made by the members. The revised exposure draft of the Shari\u2019ah Rules was presented to the Shari\u2019ah Board in its meeting No. (2) held in Mecca on 10-15 Ramadan 1420 A.H., corresponding to 18-22 December 1999 A.D. The Shari\u2019ah Board made further amendments to the exposure draft of the Shari\u2019ah Rules and decided that it should be distributed to specialists and interested parties in order to obtain their comments in order to discuss them in a public hearing. A public hearing was held in Bahrain on 29\u201330 Dhul-Hajjah 1421 A.H., corresponding to 4-5 April 2000 A.D. The public hearing was attended by more than 30 participants representing central banks, institutions, accounting firms, Shari\u2019ah scholars, academics and others who are interested in this field. The members responded to the written comments that were sent prior to the public hearing as well as to the oral comments that were expressed in the public hearing.

Some paragraphs were adopted by the unanimous vote of the members of the Shari\u2019ah Board, while the other paragraphs were adopted by the majority vote of the members, as recorded in the minutes of the Shari\u2019ah Board. The Shari\u2019ah Board decided in its meeting No. (7) held in Makkah Al- Mukarramah on 9-13 Ramadan 1422 A.H., corresponding 24-28 November 2001 A.D., to pass a resolution to reformat all Shari\u2019ah rules in a form of standards and a committee was formed for this purpose.

The Shari\u2019ah Standards Review Committee reviewed the standard in its meeting held in Rabi\u2019 II, 1433 A.H., corresponding to March 2012 A.D., in the State of Qatar, and proposed after deliberation a set of amendments (additions, deletions, and rephrasing) as deemed necessary, and then submitted the proposed amendments to the Shari\u2019ah Board for approval as it deemed necessary.

This mark-up may be a percentage of the selling price or a lump sum. This transaction may be concluded either without a prior promise to buy, in which case it is called an ordinary Mura- bahah, or with a prior promise to buy submitted by a person interested in acquiring goods through the Institution, in which case it is called a \u201cbanking Murabahah\u201d i.e. Murabahah to the purchase orderer.

The Murabahah is also analogous to a form of sale called Tawliyyah (which means to sell as per (which means to sell as per the purchasing price without making profit). This is because the Prophet (peace be upon him) purchased a she-camel from Abu Bakr to use it as a transportation to immigrate to Medina.

The Institution is entitled to acquire the commodity from another supplier provided the commodity complies with the de- sired specification. The customer may be forced to fulfil his obligation on the basis of general sources of the Qur`an and Sunnah that require fulfilment of obligation and undertaking. The International Fiqh Acade- my has issued a resolution endorsing a unilateral binding promise. \u25a0 The basis for allowing price quotations be submitted in the name of customer is because such an act has no contractual effect if there is no acceptance by the customer. The basis why it is preferred that the quotation be submitted in the name of the Institution, is to avoid confusion and this is what was endorsed by the Fatwas of Qatar Islamic Bank, and Kuwait Finance House. \u25a0 The basis for not allowing a Murabahah deal when the customer accepts the deal directly from the supplier is because, by this, a sale contract has taken place between the customer and the supplier in which case the commodity enters into ownership of the customer. This ruling will not be affected whether or not the customer has paid the price. This is be- cause payment is not a condition for the permissibility and conclusion of and conclusion of a contract as payment of the price is but a consequence of a contract and is not principal requirement or a condition for regarding a contract valid."

On Tuesday 13 Dhul-Hajjah 1419 A.H., corresponding to 30 March 1999 A.D., the Fatwa and Arbitration Committee recommended to the Shari\u2019ah Board the commissioning of a Shari\u2019ah consultant to prepare a juristic study and an exposure draft of the Shari\u2019ah Rules for Murabahah. In its meeting held on 13-14 Rajab 1420 A.H., corresponding to 22- 23 October 1999 A.D., the Fatwa and Arbitration Committee discussed the exposure draft of the Shari\u2019ah Rules for Murabahah, and asked the consultant to make the amendments in light of the comments made by the members. The revised exposure draft of the Shari\u2019ah Rules was presented to the Shari\u2019ah Board in its meeting No. (2) held in Mecca on 10-15 Ramadan 1420 A.H., corresponding to 18-22 December 1999 A.D. The Shari\u2019ah Board made further amendments to the exposure draft of the Shari\u2019ah Rules and decided that it should be distributed to specialists and interested parties in order to obtain their comments in order to discuss them in a public hearing. A public hearing was held in Bahrain on 29\u201330 Dhul-Hajjah 1421 A.H., corresponding to 4-5 April 2000 A.D. The public hearing was attended by more than 30 participants representing central banks, institutions, accounting firms, Shari\u2019ah scholars, academics and others who are interested in this field. The members responded to the written comments that were sent prior to the public hearing as well as to the oral comments that were expressed in the public hearing. The Shari\u2019ah Studies Committee and the Fatwa and Arbitration Committee held a joint meeting on 21-23 Muharram 1421 A.H., corresponding to 26-28 April 2000 A.D., to discuss the comments made about the exposure draft of the Shari\u2019ah Rules. The joint meeting made the necessary amendments, which it deemed necessary in light of the discussions that took place in the public hearing. The Shari\u2019ah Board in its meeting No. (4) held on 25\u201327 Safar 1421 A.H., corresponding to 29\u201331 May 2000 A.D., in Al-Madinah Al-Munawwarah discussed the amendments made by the Shari\u2019ah Studies Committee and the Fatwa and Arbitration Committee, and made the necessary amendments, which it deemed necessary. The standard was adopted with the name of \u201cShari\u2019ah Rules for the Murabahah\u201d. Some paragraphs were adopted by the unanimous vote of the members of the Shari\u2019ah Board, while the other paragraphs were adopted by the majority vote of the members, as recorded in the minutes of the Shari\u2019ah Board. The Shari\u2019ah Board decided in its meeting No. (7) held in Makkah Al- Mukarramah on 9-13 Ramadan 1422 A.H., corresponding 24-28 November 2001 A.D., to pass a resolution to reformat all Shari\u2019ah rules in a form of standards and a committee was formed for this purpose. In its meeting No. (8) held in Al-Madinah Al-Munawwarah on 28 Safar - 4 Rabi\u2019 I, 1423 A.H., corresponding to 11-16 May 2002 A.D., the Shari\u2019ah Board adopted the reformatting of the Shari\u2019ah Rules for Investment and Financing No. (1) on Murabahah with the name of Shari\u2019ah Standard No. (8) on Murabahah. The Shari\u2019ah Standards Review Committee reviewed the standard in its meeting held in Rabi\u2019 II, 1433 A.H., corresponding to March 2012 A.D., in the State of Qatar, and proposed after deliberation a set of amendments (additions, deletions, and rephrasing) as deemed necessary, and then submitted the proposed amendments to the Shari\u2019ah Board for approval as it deemed necessary. In its meeting No. (39) held in the Kingdom of Bahrain on 13-15 Muharram 1435 A.H., corresponding to 6-8 November 2014 A.D., the Shari\u2019ah Board discussed the proposed amendments submitted by the Shari\u2019ah Standards Review Committee.

The Murabahah is also analogous to a form of sale called Tawliyyah (which means to sell as per (which means to sell as per the purchasing price without making profit).

The Institution is entitled to acquire the commodity from another supplier provided the commodity complies with the de- sired specification. The customer may be forced to fulfil his obligation on the basis of general sources of the Qur`an and Sunnah that require fulfilment of obligation and undertaking. The International Fiqh Acade- my has issued a resolution endorsing a unilateral binding promise. \u25a0 The basis for allowing price quotations be submitted in the name of customer is because such an act has no contractual effect if there is no acceptance by the customer. The basis why it is preferred that the quotation be submitted in the name of the Institution, is to avoid confusion and this is what was endorsed by the Fatwas of Qatar Islamic Bank, and Kuwait Finance House. \u25a0 The basis for not allowing a Murabahah deal when the customer accepts the deal directly from the supplier is because, by this, a sale contract has taken place between the customer and the supplier in which case the commodity enters into ownership of the customer. This ruling will not be affected whether or not the customer has paid the price.

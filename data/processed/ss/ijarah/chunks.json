However, it is permissible to have a master agreement drawn up coveringa number of Ijarah transactions between the Institution and the customer, setting out the general terms and conditions of agreement between the two parties. In this case, there may either be a separate lease contract for each transaction, in a specific written document signed by the two parties, or alternatively the two parties may exchange notices of offer and acceptance by referring to the terms and conditions contained in the master agreement."

Thus, if the customer, in case of Ijarah associated with a promise to transfer ownership, breaches his promise, the promisor shall be charged either the difference between the cost of the asset intended to be leased and the total lease rentals for the asset which is leased on the basis of Ijarah Muntahia Bittamleek to a third party, or, in case of operating Ijarah, the promisor breaching his promise shall be charged the difference between the cost of acquisition and the total selling price if sold to a third party by the Institution (promisee). Otherwise; i.e., in case it is not sold, the promisee shall not be entitled to receive any compensation."

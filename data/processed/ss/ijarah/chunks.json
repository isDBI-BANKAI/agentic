The Shari\u2019ah Standards Committee and the Fatwa and Arbitration Com- mittee held a joint meeting on 21-23 Muharram 1421 A.H., corresponding to 26-28 April 2000 A.D., to discuss the comments made about the Shari\u2019ah Rules. The committee made the amendments which it considered necessary in light of the discussions that took place in the public hearing. The Shari\u2019ah Board in its meeting No. (4) held on 25\u201327 Safar 1421 A.H. corresponding to 29\u201331 May 2000 A.D., in Al-Madinah Al-Munawwarah discussed the amendments made by the Shari\u2019ah Studies Committee and the Fatwa and Arbitration Committee, and made the amendments which it considered necessary. Some paragraphs of the standard were adopted in the name of Shari\u2019ah Rules for Ijarah and Ijarah Muntahia Bittamleek by the unanimous vote of the members of the Shari\u2019ah Board, while the other paragraphs were adopted by the majority vote of the members, as recorded in the minutes of the Shari\u2019ah Board. In its meeting No. (7) held on 9-13 Ramadan 1422 A.H. corresponding to 24-28 November 2001 A.D., in Makkah Al-Mukarramah, the Shari\u2019ah Board decided to convert all Shari\u2019ah rules for Investments and Financing to Standards and a committee was formed for this purpose. In its meeting No. (8) held in Al-Madinah Al-Munawwarah on 28 Safar - 4 Rabi\u2019 I, 1423 A.H. corresponding to 11-16 May 2002 A.D., the Shari\u2019ah Board adopted the reformatting of Shari\u2019ah Rules for Ijarah and Ijarah Muntahia Bittamleek in the name of Shari\u2019ah Standard No. (9) on Ijarah and Ijarah Muntahia Bittamleek. The committee did not make any changes to the substance. The Shari\u2019ah Standards Review Committee reviewed the standard in its meeting held in Rabi\u2019 II, 1433 A.H. corresponding to March 2012 A.D., in the State of Qatar, and proposed after deliberation a set of amendments (additions, deletions, and rephrasing) as deemed necessary, and then submitted the proposed amendments to the Shari\u2019ah Board for approval as it deemed necessary."

The Ijarah is also acceptable by reasoning because it is a convenient means for people to acquire right to use assets that they do not own since not all people may be able to own tangible assets. \u25a0 The Ijarah Muntahia Bittamleek, on the other hand, is not different in its rules from an ordinary Ijarah, except that it is associated with a promise by the lessor to transfer ownership at the end of the Ijarah term. The permissibility of this form of Ijarah is confirmed by the resolution of International Islamic Fiqh Academy which explained the impermissible and the permissible forms of Ijarah Muntahia Bittamleek. (7) \u25a0 It must be noted that the permissible Ijarah Muntahia Bittamleek is different from hire-purchase as commonly practised by the conventional"

This is because a binding promise has financial implications if the promissor retracts the promise. The request for payment of a commitment fee is to cater for financial damage that the Institution may have incurred as a result of the promissor taking back the promise or defaulting in payment. The unified Shari\u2019ah Supervisory Board of Al Baraka issued a Fatwa in respect to Hamish Jiddiyyah (security deposit) in Murabahah. (8) This ruling is also applicable to Ijarah."

This is prohibited by a well-known Hadith which prohibits two sales in one sale. (10) \u25a0 The basis for the permissibility of sub-leasing when the lessor has allowed it is because the lessee has ownership of the usufruct by virtue of the Ijarah contract, in which case he is entitled to transfer such usufruct for consideration as he deems fit. The basis for impermissibility of sub- leasing when the lessor has not allowed it is because the ownership of usufruct by the lessee is limited in which case the lessee is obliged to consider any limitations on this ownership. \u25a0 The basis for the permissibility of leasing a property on the basis of specifications even if the lessor does not own it is that this will not lead to dispute, in which case it is similar to a Salam contract. However, in this case the lessor should not request advance payment of the rentals according to one of the views of the Shafi\u2019is and Hanbalis. \u25a0 The basis for preferring that the agent who purchases on behalf of the Institution be someone other than the customer (lessee) is to avoid fictitious transactions and to demonstrate the genuine role of the Insti- tution in making the usufruct of the asset available to the lessee."

        "content": "Shari\u2019ah Standard No. (9) Ijarah and Ijarah Muntahia Bittamleek (Revised Standard) > Contract of Ijarah > 1\n\n\u25a0 The basis for the binding nature of an Ijarah contract is because Ijarah is one of the contracts for transferring ownership that depends on an exchange of counter-values. The Shari\u2019ah principle is that these contracts are binding because of the Saying of Allah, the Almighty: {\u201c... Fulfil (your) obligations...\u201d} (11) The basis for allowing cancellation of an Ijarah contract due to contingencies is because without the right to cancel the Ijarah contract the lessee would waste money by paying rent for unneeded usufruct due to an event of which he did not contribute to the occurrence. \u25a0 The basis for requiring a designated term for the lease is because without such a designated term there would be an uncertainty that might lead to dispute. The basis for allowing an Ijarah contract take effect based on future events is because Ijarah is, unlike a sale contract, a contract that involves time and for this it is relevant that it be contingent on future events. \u25a0 The basis for the permissibility of obtaining \u2019Arboun (Earnest Money) to secure performance is the practice of Umar Ibn Al-Khattab (may Allah be pleased with him) in the presence of some companions of the Prophet (peace be upon him). This practice is also permitted by Imam Ahmad. A resolution has been issued in connection with the permis- sibility of \u2019Arboun (Earnest Money) by the International Islamic Fiqh Academy. (12) \u25a0 The basis for the impermissibility of re-leasing after the lease of the asset is that under the first contract, the usufruct of the asset no longer belongs to the owner, and a new contract may not be signed with another lessee before the contract with the first lessee is terminated. Hence, this form of Ijarah is not suitable as an investment instrument, because it constitutes an impermissible sale of the rent receivable pursuant to providing new lessees with an asset already leased out to the existing lessee. The form just described is different from the transfer, by the owner, of the ownership of the leased assets to an investor, so that the latter takes his place, wholly or partially, with regard to the ownership of all or some parts of the assets, as well as in the ownership of the usufruct of, and entitlement to his share of the rent from, those assets. Al Baraka Forum has issued a resolution disallowing multiple leases of the same asset after the first Ijarah contract. (13) \u25a0 The basis for allowing successive leases on the same specified usufruct of a particular asset without specifying a particular period for a particular person is because the usufruct -in line with the term assigned to each party- can accommodate the parties. The justification for not allowing a specific term for each person is that each party will know the term to which he is entitled in his turn and because their applications are considered in order. This rule was supported by a resolution of Al Baraka Forum."

The jurists have considered a bankrupt lessor -a person who leases things he does not own- among those who must be restricted in using their property."

The basis for the requirement that benefit from Ijarah must be permissible is that leasing an asset that will be used in impermissible way makes the lessor an accomplice in doing evil and this is prohibited as per the saying of Allah, the Almighty: {\u201cHelp you one another in Al-Birr and At-Taqwa (virtue, righteousness and piety)\u201d} (15) \u25a0 The basis for the impermissibility of stipulating a defect exclusion clause in respect to the leased asset is that such a condition defeats the purpose of the contract, which is exchange of usufruct for rentals. If the usufruct is partially or wholly impaired, the receipt of the rentals by the lessor becomes a form of unjust enrichment. The resolution of the International Islamic Fiqh Academy has declared that the lessor must accept responsibility for any destruction or impairment of the leased asset insofar as these events are not sustained as a result of misconduct or negligence on the part of the lessee. (16) The Fatwa of the unified Shari\u2019ah Supervisory Board of Al Baraka states that the lessor is not entitled to exclude his liability in respect of defects in the leased asset. (17) \u25a0 The reason why the lessor may not stipulate that the lessee will undertake the major maintenance of the leased asset is that this condition defeats the purpose of an Ijarah contract. Again, it is the duty of the lessor to ensure that the usufruct is intact, and this is not possible unless the asset is maintained and kept safe so that the lessor may be entitled"

The unified Shari\u2019ah Supervisory Board of Al Baraka issued a fatwa supporting this. (18) \u25a0 The reason why insurance expenses must be borne by the lessor is that the owner of the asset is responsible for insuring it, and the lessor is the owner. This is supported by the resolution issued by the International Islamic Fiqh Academy. (19) \u25a0 The basis for the permissibility of using a certain benchmark or price index to determine rentals of subsequent periods after the expiration of the first period of an Ijarah contract is that the rentals will subsequently be known. This is similar to the principle of Ujrat al- Mithl (prevailing market rate of rental) and does not lead to dispute. Again, using a benchmark to determine the rentals is to the benefit of all parties since there is possibility of rental fluctuation that may be in favour of either the lessee or the lessor in view of the fact that the contract remains binding on both parties throughout its term. This rule is supported by a Fatwa issued during Al Baraka\u2019s 11 th Forum. Forum. \u25a0 The basis for the permissibility of restructuring the rentals for the future periods is that such an act is deemed to create a new contract for a new term for which the rentals are not yet due. Hence, the rentals are not regarded as a debt, in which case the prohibition of rescheduling rentals in return for higher payment is not applicable to this. However, increasing previously agreed rentals in exchange for a deferred period of payment is a form of Riba."

This is because if the contract were to be bin- ding in spite of such contingencies, then a person with a valid excuse may incur loss that was not a result of a contract. The Shari\u2019ah Super- visory Board of the Kuwait Finance House (23) and the unified Shari\u2019ah and the unified Shari\u2019ah Supervisory Board of Al Baraka (24) have issued a supporting Fatwa in have issued a supporting Fatwa in this regard. \u25a0 The basis for the permissibility that the lessor may stipulate that an Ijarah contract be terminated due to non-payment of rental by the lessee is that contractual stipulations are primarily valid and enforceable. This stipulation does not legalise impermissible acts or invalidate permissible acts. Therefore, the permissibility of this stipulation comes under the of this stipulation comes under the prophetic Hadith stating: \u201cMuslims are bound by the conditions they made except a condition that legalises impermissible act or invalidates permissible act\u201d (25) \u25a0 The basis of the rule that Ijarah does not terminate with the death of either party thereto is that the subject-matter of the contract is the asset and as long as the asset is available the Ijarah contract remains unaffected. The basis for the right of the lessee\u2019s heirs to terminate the Ijarah if they can prove that the contract has become too onerous for their resources is to avoid inflicting damage on the heirs. This exceptional ruling is taken from the Maliki School of law since it serves the interests of the lessee.

The International Islamic Fiqh Academy has issued a resolution in this regard. (26) \u25a0 The basis for the rule that the promise of a client to take an asset acquired by the Institution on lease is binding is that the Institution has acquired the asset in order to lease it to the client due to the promise. Therefore, the rule that the promise to take the asset on lease is binding will protect the promisee. \u25a0 The basis for not allowing bilateral promises is that the resemblance of these promises to a contract, i.e. a contract is effected before taking ownership of the subject matter of the contract. The International Islamic Fiqh Academy has issued a resolution in this regard. (27) \u25a0 The basis for the permissibility of a gift contingent upon the expiry of the Ijarah term is that a conditional gift is valid. The Prophet (peace be upon him) sent a gift to Negus (the former emperor of Ethiopia) on condition that he was alive at the time of the arrival of the messenger. (28) The basis for the permissibility of leasing an asset to the person from whom it is purchased by way of Ijarah Muntahia Bittamleek on condition that the parties observe the lapse of a period of time is that this prevents the contract from becoming a \u2019Inah transaction. This is because the physical changes to the asset or changes in the value of the asset during this period give it the economic characteristics of a different asset. \u25a0 The basis for the requirement that all the rules prescribed for an ordinary lease are applicable to Ijarah Muntahia Bittamleek is that a mere promise to transfer ownership does exclude the contract from becoming an Ijarah contract or from the applicable rules.

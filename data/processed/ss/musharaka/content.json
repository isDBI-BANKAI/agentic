The explanation of these partnerships includes definitions, rulings applicable to each partnership and the Shari\u2019ah lim- itations that must be taken into account by Islamic financial Institutions (Institution/Institutions).

The standard also applies to all modern forms of partnerships including diminishing Musharakah. The standard does not cover ownership partnership where the parties jointly own an asset. It does not include rules for Sharikat al-Mufawadah because the practical application of this form of partnership is rare and, if need be, reference should be made to Fiqh books. The standard does not cover Mudarabah, because this form of partnership has a separate standard. In the same vein, it does not cover sharecropping partnerships, such as irrigation and agricultural partnerships. The standard also does not cover, as far as modern partnerships are concerned, regulatory policies and procedures necessary for operations in the market.",

            "content": "In its meeting No. (5) held in Makkah Al-Mukarramah during the period of 8-12 Ramadan 1421 A.H., corresponding to 4-8 December 2001 A.D., the Shari\u2019ah Board decided to give priority to the preparation of a Shari\u2019ah Standard on Mudarabah. On Saturday 15 Dhul-Hajjah 1421 A.H., corresponding to 10 March 2001 A.D., the Fatwa and Arbitration Committee recommended to the Shari\u2019ah Board the commissioning of a Shari\u2019ah consultant to prepare a juristic study and an exposure draft on the Shari\u2019ah Standard for Mudarabah. In its meeting held on 18 Muharram 1422 A.H., corresponding to 12 April 2001 A.D., the Fatwa and Arbitration Committee discussed the exposure draft of the Shari\u2019ah Rules for Mudarabah and asked the consultant to make amendments in light of the comments made by the members. The Committee also held a meeting on 20 Jumada II, 1422 A.H., corresponding to 8 December 2001 A.D., and made some amendments in light of the comments made by the members. The revised exposure draft of the Standard was presented to the Shari\u2019ah Board in its 7th meeting held in Makkah Al-Mukarramah during the period of 9-13 Ramadan 1422 A.H., corresponding to 24-28 November 2001 A.D. The Shari\u2019ah Board made further amendments to the exposure draft of the Standard and decided that it should be distributed to specialists and interested parties in order to obtain their comments with the objective of discussing them in a public hearing. A public hearing was held in Bahrain during the period of 29-20 Dhul-Hajjah 1422 A.H., corresponding to 2-3 February 2002 A.D. The public hearing was attended by more than thirty participants representing central Institutions, Institutions, accounting firms, Shari\u2019ah scholars, academics and others who are interested in this field. Some of the members of the Shari\u2019ah Board responded to the written comments that were sent prior to the public hearing as well as to the oral comments that were expressed in the public hearing. The Shari\u2019ah Standards Committee in its meeting held during the period of 21-22 Dhul-Hajjah 1422 A.H., corresponding to 6-7 March 2002 A.D., in the Kingdom of Bahrain discussed the comments made on the exposure draft. The Committee made the amendments which it considered necessary in light of both the discussions that had taken place in the public hearing and the written comments that had been received. The Shari\u2019ah Board in its 8th meeting held on 28 Safar - 4 Rabi\u2019 I, 1423 A.H., corresponding to 11-16 May 2002 A.D., in Al-Madinah Al-Munawwarah discussed the amendments made by the Shari\u2019ah Standards Committee, and made the necessary amendments, which it deemed necessary. Some paragraphs of the standard were adopted by the unanimous vote of the members of the Shari\u2019ah Board, while the other paragraphs were adopted by the majority vote of the members, as recorded in the minutes of the Shari\u2019ah Board. The Shari\u2019ah Standards Review Committee reviewed the Standard in its meeting held on Rabi\u2019 II, 1433 A.H., corresponding to March 2012 A.D., in the State of Qatar, and proposed after deliberation a set of amendments (additions, deletions, and rephrasing) as deemed necessary, and then submitted the proposed amendments to the Shari\u2019ah Board for approval as it deemed necessary. In its 41st meeting held in Al-Madinah Al-Munawwarah, Kingdom of Saudi Arabia during the period of 27-29 Sha\u2019ban 1436 A.H., corresponding to 14-16 June 2015 A.D., the Shari\u2019ah Board discussed the proposed amendments submitted by the Shari\u2019ah Standards Review Committee. After deliberation, the Shari\u2019ah Board approved necessary amendments, and the Standard was adopted in its current amended version.",

A debt fails to meet this requirement, as it is a receivable that is not available for use when the contract is concluded.

Likewise, a supererogatory prayer is not acceptable unless the obligatory prayer is performed\u201d This Hadith shows that distribution of profit prior to recovery of the capital, or unless the capital is maintained intact, is invalid. Moreover, profit is an addition to the capital and such an addition cannot be recognised or realised unless the capital that is the source of the profit is maintained."

The Mecca based Islamic Fiqh Academy has issued a resolution in support of constructive valuation."

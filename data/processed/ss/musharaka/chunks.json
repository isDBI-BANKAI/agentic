The explanation of these partnerships includes definitions, rulings applicable to each partnership and the Shari\u2019ah lim- itations that must be taken into account by Islamic financial Institutions (Institution/Institutions). (1) The word (Institution/Institutions) is used here to refer, in short, to Islamic financial institutions including Islamic Banks."

Scope of the Standard\n\nThis standard covers all forms of traditional Fiqh-nominate partnerships that operate on the basis of Sharikat al-\u2019Aqd (contractual partnership), except the partnerships that are explicitly excluded by this standard as indicated below. The standard also applies to all modern forms of partnerships including diminishing Musharakah. The standard does not cover ownership partnership where the parties jointly own an asset. It does not include rules for Sharikat al-Mufawadah because the practical application of this form of partnership is rare and, if need be, reference should be made to Fiqh books. The standard does not cover Mudarabah, because this form of partnership has a separate standard. In the same vein, it does not cover sharecropping partnerships, such as irrigation and agricultural partnerships. The standard also does not cover, as far as modern partnerships are concerned, regulatory policies and procedures necessary for operations in the market."

This is because the subject matter of the partnership is an obligation or a liability that is contingent on creditworthiness (outstanding reputation). This is the obligation of the partners to pay the amount of debts created through purchases on credit, which form the liability of the partners. Therefore, the parties should agree on the ratio of liability for which each partner is responsible when paying such debts."

The Shari\u2019ah basis for this is the Hadith stating: \u201cThe Messenger of Allah has prohibited concluding partnership with Jews and Christians unless the selling and buying is in the hands of the Muslim (4) The cause of the prohibition is the fear of being involved in interest-based transactions or in concluding impermissible contracts and this fear is absent when there are guarantees to observe and apply Shari\u2019ah rulings.

This objective is realisable even if the capital is contributed in the form of tangible assets just as it is in the case of a contribution in cash. Therefore, it is just as valid to present tangible assets for Sharikah investment as to present cash. At the liquidation, each one of the partners will be entitled to the equivalent value of the assets presented at the conclusion of the Sharikah. (8) This is the view of the Maliki and the Hanbali scholars. (9)"

This is evidenced by the Hadith in which Ibn Umar asked the Prophet (peace be upon him) concerning selling camels at (a place in Medina called Al-Baqi\u2019) in a currency and collecting payment in a different currency. The Prophet (peace be upon him) endorsed the transaction provided it had taken place according to the current exchange rate. (10)"

It is not permissible that the capital of Sharikah be ambiguous since certainty as to the amount of the capital is a benchmark for sharing profit. The equitable distribution of profit is not possible if the amount of capital contributed by each party is ambiguous. (11)"

However, it is permissible for the two parties to construct a separate agreement independent of the Mudarabah contract assigning one party to perform, for a fee, a business activity that is not by custom part of Mudarabah operations. The independence of this separate agreement means that if the contract of providing this activity is terminated, this will not affect the contract of Mudarabah."

In this case, as he is a trustee the Mudarib is not liable for the amount of this loss, unless there is negligence or misconduct on his part.

On Saturday 15 Dhul-Hajjah 1421 A.H., corresponding to 10 March 2001 A.D., the Fatwa and Arbitration Committee recommended to the Shari\u2019ah Board the commissioning of a Shari\u2019ah consultant to prepare a juristic study and an exposure draft on the Shari\u2019ah Standard for Mudarabah. In its meeting held on 18 Muharram 1422 A.H., corresponding to 12 April 2001 A.D., the Fatwa and Arbitration Committee discussed the exposure draft of the Shari\u2019ah Rules for Mudarabah and asked the consultant to make amendments in light of the comments made by the members. The Committee also held a meeting on 20 Jumada II, 1422 A.H., corresponding to 8 December 2001 A.D., and made some amendments in light of the comments made by the members. The revised exposure draft of the Standard was presented to the Shari\u2019ah Board in its 7th meeting held in Makkah Al-Mukarramah during the period of 9-13 Ramadan 1422 A.H., corresponding to 24-28 November 2001 A.D. The Shari\u2019ah Board made further amendments to the exposure draft of the Standard and decided that it should be distributed to specialists and interested parties in order to obtain their comments with the objective of discussing them in a public hearing. A public hearing was held in Bahrain during the period of 29-20 Dhul-Hajjah 1422 A.H., corresponding to 2-3 February 2002 A.D. The public hearing was attended by more than thirty participants representing central Institutions, Institutions, accounting firms, Shari\u2019ah scholars, academics and others who are interested in this field. Some of the members of the Shari\u2019ah Board responded to the written comments that were sent prior to the public hearing as well as to the oral comments that were expressed in the public hearing. The Shari\u2019ah Standards Committee in its meeting held during the period of 21-22 Dhul-Hajjah 1422 A.H., corresponding to 6-7 March 2002 A.D., in the Kingdom of Bahrain discussed the comments made on the exposure draft. The Committee made the amendments which it considered necessary in light of both the discussions that had taken place in the public hearing and the written comments that had been received. The Shari\u2019ah Board in its 8th meeting held on 28 Safar - 4 Rabi\u2019 I, 1423 A.H., corresponding to 11-16 May 2002 A.D., in Al-Madinah Al-Munawwarah discussed the amendments made by the Shari\u2019ah Standards Committee, and made the necessary amendments, which it deemed necessary. Some paragraphs of the standard were adopted by the unanimous vote of the members of the Shari\u2019ah Board, while the other paragraphs were adopted by the majority vote of the members, as recorded in the minutes of the Shari\u2019ah Board. The Shari\u2019ah Standards Review Committee reviewed the Standard in its meeting held on Rabi\u2019 II, 1433 A.H., corresponding to March 2012 A.D., in the State of Qatar, and proposed after deliberation a set of amendments (additions, deletions, and rephrasing) as deemed necessary, and then submitted the proposed amendments to the Shari\u2019ah Board for approval as it deemed necessary. In its 41st meeting held in Al-Madinah Al-Munawwarah, Kingdom of Saudi Arabia during the period of 27-29 Sha\u2019ban 1436 A.H., corresponding to 14-16 June 2015 A.D., the Shari\u2019ah Board discussed the proposed amendments submitted by the Shari\u2019ah Standards Review Committee. After deliberation, the Shari\u2019ah Board approved necessary amendments, and the Standard was adopted in its current amended version."

These conditions were brought before the Prophet (peace be upon him) and he approved them\u201d. Among the Hadiths regarding the permissibility of Mudarabah is the case that states that \u201cUmar Ibn Al-Khattab gave one man the funds belonging to an orphan for the purpose of Mudarabah and the man was trading with these funds in Iraq\u201d."

In other words, there are some individuals who are rich but lack business or investment know-how and others who have business or investment expertise but lack money. This situation thus calls for the permissibility of the Mudarabah contract so as to combine the interests of the two parties."

A debt fails to meet this requirement, as it is a receivable that is not available for use when the contract is concluded. Moreover, considering a debt as capital of Mudarabah involves potential Riba. This is because the creditor may be suspected of having extended the debt tenure in order to get additional consideration (for the extension) from the debtor under the name of Mudarabah."

Likewise, a supererogatory prayer is not acceptable unless the obligatory prayer is performed\u201d This Hadith shows that distribution of profit prior to recovery of the capital, or unless the capital is maintained intact, is invalid.

This combination of assets for making profit necessitates bearing losses, if any. The ownership partnership is created by events beyond the partners\u2019 control such as the inheritance rights of heirs in the legacy of a deceased person. This partnership is also created by the wish of the partners such as when two or more parties acquire common shares in a particular asset."

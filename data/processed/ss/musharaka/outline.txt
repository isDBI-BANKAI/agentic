      - 3/1 General rulings for Sharikah, especially Sharikat al-’Inan — `general_rulings`
      - 3/1/1 Conclusion of a Sharikah contract — `contract_conclusion`
        - 3/1/1/1 A Sharikah contract can be concluded by agreement between the parties concerned on the basis of offer and acceptance. The contract of partnership should, if necessary, be documented and registered officially. The objectives of the partnership must be clearly spelt out in the document of partnership or in the articles of association of the company. — `contract_requirements`
        - 3/1/1/2 It is permissible for the Institution to enter into a part- nership contract with non-Muslims or conventional banks to carry out operations acceptable by Shari’ah — `contract_permissibility`
        - 3/1/1/3 It is permissible for the Institutions to include con- ventional banks as partners in a syndicated financing which operates on the basis of Shari’ah, provided that the Institution secures the right to manage the partner- ship’s operations and that such operations are subject to the Shari’ah supervision. [see Shari’ah Standard No. (24) on Syndicated Financing] — `contract_permissibility`
        - 3/1/1/4 It is permissible for the partners to amend at any point of time the terms of a partnership contract. They may make changes to the ratio of profit-sharing, taking into account that any losses are shared according to the share of each partner in the partnership capital. — `contract_amendments`
      - 3/1/2 The capital of Sharikah — `sharikah_capital`
        - 3/1/2/1 In principle, the capital of Sharikah should be con- tributed in the form of monetary assets on which one can rely in order to determine the amount of the capital and to recognise profit or loss. Nevertheless, it is permissible, with the agreement of all partners, to provide tangible assets (commodities) as the capital of Sharikah after the monetary values of these assets are determined and expressed in currency in order to know the share contributed by each partner. — `capital_requirements`
        - 3/1/2/2 If partners have contributed their partnership cap- ital in different currencies, these currencies must be translated into the currency of the Sharikah at current exchange rates so as to determine the shares and liabilities of each partner. — `capital_currency`
        - 3/1/2/3 The share of each partner in the capital should be determined, whether it is contributed in the form of one lump sum or by more than one payment over time; i.e., when there is a need for additional funds to increase the capital. — `capital_shares`
        - 3/1/2/4 It is not permitted that debts (receivables) alone be used as a contribution to the Sharikah capital. However, debts may form part of the contribution to the capital where they become inseparable from other assets that can be presented as a contribution to the capital in Sharikah, such as when a manufacturing firm use its net assets as a contribution to the capital. [see Shari’ah Standard No. (21) on Financial Paper] — `capital_restrictions`
        - 3/1/2/5 The funds of current accounts, although they are juristically classified as loans to the Institutions, can be presented as a contribution to the capital in a Sharikah either with the Institution itself or with a third party. — `capital_permissibility`
      - 3/1/3 Managing a Sharikah venture — `sharikah_management`
        - 3/1/3/1 In principle, each partner is entitled to act in the interest of the partnership in the following transactions: spot or deferred sales; taking possession or custody of the partnership receivables; making payments or deposits and providing or receiving a mortgage on behalf of the partnership; asking for payment of debts, admission of liabilities, taking up legal actions, cancellation of contracts, rejecting defective goods, renting the assets of the partnership, processing transfers of rights and debts; requesting credit facilities in the interest of partnership; and doing what is customary in the interest of trading. A partner is not entitled to act against the interest of the partnership or to perform actions that will damage the partnership, such as giving out grants or loans, unless all the partners have consented to such an action. However, the partner may give out short-term minor loans that will not, according to customary practice, affect the operation of partnership. — `partner_rights_obligations`
        - 3/1/3/2 It is permissible for the partners to agree that the management of the partnership will be restricted to certain partners or to a single partner. In this case, the other partners are bound to abide by their consent not to act on behalf of the partnership. — `management_restrictions`
        - 3/1/3/3 It is permissible for the partners to appoint a manager other than one of the partners and pay him a fixed remuneration that will be included in the expenses of the Sharikah. It is also permissible that the partners set aside a portion of the investment profit plus a fixed remuneration as a form of incentive for the manager. However, if the management is carried out from the outset for a percentage share in the profit earned, this action classifies the manager as a Mudarib and he is only entitled to a share in the profit, if any, and deserves no further remuneration for management services. — `manager_compensation`
        - 3/1/3/4 It is not permitted, in a Sharikah contract, to specify a fixed remuneration for a partner who contributes in managing the Sharikah funds or provides some form of other services, such as accounting. However, it is permissible to give him a greater share of profit than he would receive solely on the basis of his share in the partnership capital. — `partner_compensation_restrictions`
        - 3/1/3/5 It is permissible that one of the partners be appointed to provide services that are mentioned in item 3/1/3/4 provided that the appointment is based on an inde- pendent contract from the Sharikah contract so that he may be dismissed as a manager at any point of time without the need to amend or to terminate the Shari- kah contract. In this case, the appointed partner may earn a specific remuneration. — `partner_services_compensation`
      - 3/1/4 Guarantees in a Sharikah contract — `sharikah_guarantees`
        - 3/1/4/1 All partners in a Sharikah contract maintain the assets of the Sharikah on a trust basis. Therefore, no one is liable except in cases of misconduct, negligence or breach of contract. It is not permitted to stipulate that a partner in a Sharikah contract guarantees the capital of another partner. — `guarantee_restrictions`
        - 3/1/4/2 It is permissible for a partner in a Sharikah contract to stipulate that another partner provides a personal guarantee or a mortgage to cover cases of misconduct, negligence or breach of contract. — `guarantees_permissibility`
        - 3/1/4/3 A third party may provide a guarantee to make up a loss of capital of some or all partners. This guar- antee is circumscribed with the conditions that (I) the legal capacity and financial liability of such a third party as a guarantor are independent from the Sharikah contract, (II) the guarantee should neither be provided for consideration nor linked in any manner to the Sharikah contract; (III) the third party guarantor should not own more than a half of the capital in the entity to be guaranteed, and (IV) the guaranteed entity should not own more than a half of the capital in the entity that undertakes to provide a guarantee. In case of a third party’s under- taking to guarantee, the partner benefiting from such — `third_party_guarantees`
      - 3/1/5 The outcome of Sharikah investments (profit and loss) — `profit_loss`
        - 3/1/5/1 The Sharikah contract should incorporate a provision specifying the manner of sharing profits between the parties. The allocation of profits must be made in a manner that gives each partner an undivided per- centage of profit, not a sum of money or a percentage of the capital. [see item 3/1/5/9] — `profit_sharing`
        - 3/1/5/2 It is not permitted to defer the determination of the profit percentages due to each partner until the re- alisation of profit. The profit percentage for each partner must be determined at the conclusion of Sharikah contract. The parties may bilaterally agree to amend the percentages of profit-sharing on the date of distribution. Also, a partner may relinquish, on the date of distribution, a part of the profit that is due to him in favour of another party. — `profit_percentage`
        - 3/1/5/3 In principle, the shares of profit may be in proportion to the percentage of each partner’s contribution to the Sharikah capital. Nevertheless, the partners may agree to make profit-sharing not proportionate to their contributions to capital, provided the additional percentage of profit over the percentage of contribution to the capital is not in favour of a sleeping partner. If a partner did not stipulate a condition that he be — `profit_sharing_proportion`
        - 3/1/5/4 It is a requirement that the proportions of losses borne by partners be commensurate with the proportions of their contributions to the Sharikah capital. It is not permitted, therefore, to agree on holding one partner or a group of partners liable for the entire loss or liable for a percentage of loss that does not match their share of ownership in the partnership. It is, however, valid that one partner takes, without any prior condition, the responsibility of bearing the loss at the time of the loss. — `loss_sharing`
        - 3/1/5/5 It is permissible for the partners to agree on the adoption of any method of allocation of profit, either permanent or variable, for example, by agreeing that the percentages of profit shares in the first period are one set of percentages and in the second period are another set of percentages, depending on the disparity of the two periods or the magnitude of the realised profit. This is allowed provided that using such a method does not lead to the likelihood of a partner being precluded from participation in profit. — `profit_allocation_methods`
        - 3/1/5/6 It is not permitted to start the allocation of profit be- tween the partners unless the operating costs, expenses and taxes are deducted in calculating the profit and the capital of the Sharikah is maintained intact. — `profit_calculation`
        - 3/1/5/7 It is not permitted that the conditions or modes of profit allocation in a Sharikah contract include any clause or condition that may result in the probable violation of the principle of sharing profit. For example, if a pre- determined amount of profit or a specific percentage of capital is assigned to one of the partners, this assignment will be rendered void. If the assignment — `profit_allocation_restrictions`
        - 3/1/5/8 Taking into account the provisions of item 3/1/5/3, it is permissible to agree that if the profit realised is above a certain ceiling, the profit in excess of such a ceiling belongs to a particular partner. The parties may also agree that if the profit is not over the ceiling or is below the ceiling, the distribution will be in accordance with their agreement. — `profit_ceiling`
        - 3/1/5/9 The profit may be finally distributed on the basis of the proceeds of selling all the existing assets, known as actual valuation, or on the basis of constructive valuation of assets which means valuation of the assets of the Sharikah at fair value. The receivables must be valued at the cash value that is expected to be realised, i.e. after deduction of an allowance for doubtful debts. In valuing receivables, it is not permitted to take account of the time value of money (interest) or the notion of discount on the basis of current value, i.e. a discount of the amount of the debt as consideration for earlier payment, and cash amounts shall be recognized as is. — `profit_distribution_valuation`
        - 3/1/5/10 It is not permitted that the final allocation of profit take place based on expected profit, i.e. it is necessary that the allocation of profit take place on the basis of actual profit earned through actual or constructive valuation of the sold assets. — `profit_allocation_timing`
        - 3/1/5/11 It is permissible to allocate some funds to any of the partners on account, i.e. before actual or constructive valuation, on condition that the final actual settlement will take place at a later stage. In this case, the parties — `profit_allocation_on_account`
        - 3/1/5/12 If the subject matter of Sharikah is assets acquired for leasing that bring in income or the subject matter is services that bring in revenue, then the amount distributed to the partners annually is on account, and it is subject to settlement and reimbursement at the end of the Sharikah. — `profit_allocation_leasing`
        - 3/1/5/13 It is permissible, based on the articles of association or a decision of the partners, not to distribute the profits of the company. It is also permissible to set aside periodically a certain ratio of profit as a solvency reserve or as a reserve for meeting losses of capital (investment risk reserve) or as a profit equalisation reserve. — `profit_reserves`
        - 3/1/5/14 It is permissible to agree on setting aside a proportion of profit for non-partners as a charitable donation. — `profit_charity`
      - 3/1/6 Maturity of Sharikah — `sharikah_maturity`
        - 3/1/6/1 Each partner is entitled to terminate the Sharikah (i.e. to withdraw from the partnership) after giving his partner/s due notice to this effect, in which case he shall be entitled to his share in the partnership, and this withdrawal would not necessitate the termination of the partnership of the remaining partners. It is permissible for the partners to enter into a binding promise for the continuity of the partnership for a period of time. In this case, it is permissible for the parties to agree to terminate the partnership before such a fixed period. In all these cases, the obligations and actions that took place before termination will remain unaffected and they will continue to exist. — `termination_rights`
        - 3/1/6/2 It is permissible for a partner to issue a binding promise to buy, either within the period of operation or at the time of liquidation, all the assets of the Sharikah as per their market value or as per agreement at the date of buying. It is not permissible, however, to promise to buy the assets of the Sharikah on the basis of face value. — `asset_purchase_promise`
        - 3/1/6/3 A Sharikah venture comes to an end at the expiry date or before the expiry date if the partners agree to terminate it prematurely, or, in the case of part- nership in a particular business, by actual liquidation of the assets that constitute the subject matter of the partnership. The termination of a Sharikah can take place on the basis of constructive liquidation. In this case, the Sharikah will be regarded as if it has been ended and the parties have commenced a new part- nership whereby the assets that were not sold through actual liquidation, but have been valued on the basis of constructive liquidation, will be considered as the capital of the new partnership. If the liquidation is based on the expiry date, then all the existing assets shall be sold according to current market values and the proceeds will be used as follows: a) Payment of liquidation expenses. b) Payment of financial liabilities from the net assets of the partnership. c) Distribution of the remaining assets among the partners in accordance with their percentage of contribution to the capital. If the assets fall short and the partners do not recover all of their contri- buted capital, the distribution shall take place on a pro rata basis to the shares of capital. — `liquidation_process`

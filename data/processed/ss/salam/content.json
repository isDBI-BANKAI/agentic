In this latter case, the transaction involved shall be concluded on the basis of a memorandum of understanding in which the contracting parties determine the framework of the contract and the intention of the parties to buy and sell. The parties shall also determine the quantity and specifications of the goods, the manner of their delivery, the basis for determining the price, and the manner of payment. The types of guarantees and other prospective arrangements shall also be specified in the memorandum. The execution of each Salam contract may then take place separately at the appropriate date.",

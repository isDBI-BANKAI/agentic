  to be answered.

      • Further Clarification Needed: Preferences for how payments are structured (e.g., based on completion of design, permits, construction phases).

      • What is the expected return on investment (ROI) for this factory?

  The next team of agents will map the requirements to Islamic Financial Accounting Standards (FAS). They should pay special attention to:

   2 The istisna'a contract and its suitability for financing the construction of the factory.                                                                                                         
   3 The ijarah structure to determine the viability of an equipment lease agreement.                                                                                                                  
   4 The diminishing musharaka structure to determine the feasibility of a partnership in the factory.                                                                                                 
                                                                                                                                                                                                       
  Specifically, the agents should determine if the minimal cash out preference until the factory is operational is aligned with all Islamic Financial Accounting Standards (FAS).

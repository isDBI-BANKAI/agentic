Definitions within Murabaha Contracts:**\n\n*   A potential issue arises from the varying interpretations of what constitutes a valid Murabaha contract under Sharia law and how these interpretations translate into accounting practices. Different scholars and institutions may have differing views on essential elements like the asset's ownership transfer and the determination of the profit margin. This can lead to inconsistencies in applying FAS 28.\n    *   I will search for: \"Murabaha contract definition differences Sharia accounting\"\n\n**2. Revenue and Profit Recognition in Murabaha:**\n\n*   The timing of profit recognition in Murabaha transactions is a subject of debate. Some argue for recognizing profit only upon final payment by the customer, while others advocate for recognizing it gradually over the financing period. This difference in opinion can affect the financial reporting of Islamic financial institutions.\n    *   I will search for: \"Murabaha profit recognition timing issues\"\n\n**3. Presentation and Disclosures for Murabaha:**\n\n*   There are concerns about the adequacy of disclosures related to Murabaha transactions. Some argue that existing standards may not provide sufficient transparency regarding the underlying assets, profit margins, and associated risks.\n    *   I will search for: \"Murabaha disclosure requirements adequacy\"\n\n**4. Tawarruq and Commodity Murabaha:**\n\n*   Tawarruq, especially commodity Murabaha, faces criticism due to its resemblance to conventional lending. Concerns exist about whether it truly adheres to the spirit of Islamic finance and if it's being used merely as a loophole for interest-based transactions. This raises questions about its classification and accounting treatment.\n    *   I will search for: \"Tawarruq commodity Murabaha criticism Sharia compliance\"\n\n**5. Related Accounting Treatments in Murabaha:**\n\n*   The accounting treatment of costs associated with Murabaha transactions, such as storage, transportation, and insurance, can be complex and may vary depending on the specific circumstances. This can lead to inconsistencies in how these costs are reported.\n    *   I will search for: \"Murabaha transaction costs accounting treatment\"\n\nNow I will use the `duckduckgo_search` tool to find information on these topics.\n### External Issues and Gaps\n\n*   **Definitions within Murabaha contracts:** The lack of universally accepted definitions for key terms in Murabaha contracts leads to inconsistencies in interpretation and application.\n    *   Variations in Sharia interpretations impact contract structuring and accounting treatment.\n*   **Revenue and profit recognition in Murabaha:** The timing of profit recognition in Murabaha contracts is a point of contention.\n    *   Some argue for recognizing profit over the contract term (straight-line basis), aligning with the financing nature of the transaction, as suggested by FAS 28.\n    *   Others suggest that IFRS 9 is more appropriate.\n*   **Presentation and disclosures for Murabaha:** The adequacy of current disclosure requirements for Murabaha transactions is questioned.\n    *   There is a need for more transparent and comprehensive disclosures to enable stakeholders to understand the risks and economic substance of these transactions.\n*   **Tawarruq and commodity Murabaha:** Sharia compliance concerns surrounding Tawarruq and commodity Murabaha transactions.\n    *   Some scholars view these structures as a form of \"riba\" (interest) due to their resemblance to conventional lending.\n*   **Related accounting treatments in Murabaha:** Accounting for transaction costs in Murabaha contracts is complex, and different interpretations exist regarding their treatment.\n    *   Some argue that these costs should be expensed immediately, while others advocate for capitalization as part of the asset's cost.\n",

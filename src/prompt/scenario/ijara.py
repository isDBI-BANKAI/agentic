For Lessee Accounting:
  2.1. Calculations:
  - Advance Rental Before Ijarah Commencement If paid prior to the lease start: 
    Advance against Ijarah =Advance rental amount (if any)
    -> Dr. Advance against Ijarah (SFP)
  - At Commencement of Ijarah - Initial Recognition:
    Right-of-Use Asset: Right-of-Use = Asset purchase price + Initial direct costs - Terminal value Dr. Right-of-use Asset (SFP)
    Gross Ijarah Liability: Gross Ijarah Liability = Rental amount * Ijarah term
    -> Dr. Gross Ijarah Liability (SFP)
    Deferred Ijarah Cost: Deferred Ijarah Cost = Gross Ijarah Liability - Right-of-Use Asset 
    -> Dr. Deferred Ijarah Cost (SFP)
    -> Cr. Ijarah Liability (SFP) = Right-of-use + Deferred Ijarah - Advance rentals

    Amortisation Amount = (Right-of-use - (Residual value - Terminal value)) ÷ Useful life

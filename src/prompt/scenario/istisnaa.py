To help you, a special flow breakdown is provided by a financial accounting expert, this also guided your reasoning and step by step execution:

1. Initially, figure out if there is only Istisnaa contract between customer and the bank (the seller) or if there is parallel istisnaa contract that is between the contractor and the bank when the bank enter into a second Istisnaa contract in order to fulfil the customer contractual obligations in the first istisna contract. 

2. Extract needed, complete and accurate data from the scenario:
- Price (of the Istisna contract and Parallel istisna contract if there is)
- Cost: Direct costs and indirect costs Indirect costs relating to the contract as allocated on an objective basis. (mainly with Contractor)
- Accounting entry method: either the percentage of completion or the completed contract methods 
- Payment terms
- Delivery period

2. Perform the accounting calculations, here are some Accounting Logic, combine them with the FAS context/explanation to provide a clear Output of Istisnaa journaling using the Percentage of Completion Method:

    1- Calculations:
        - The bank's profit: Bank Profit = Price - Cost
        - Cost of Istisna'a Revenue= Cost * percentage of Completion
        - Revenue = Price* percentage of Completion
        - Profit = Bank Profit * percentage of Completion 
    2- Journal Entries Format:
        # For each period of time (All Quarters required: Q1, Q2, Q3, Q4) record the following:
            a- Recording costs;
                -> Record Cost Incurred:
                    Dr. Istisna'a Work In Progress (SFP)     XXX
                    Cr. Bank/ Account Payable/ Cash (SFP)     XXX
            b- Revenue and Profit Recognition:
                ->  Revenue Recognition
                    Dr. Istisna'a Receivable     XXX
                    Cr. Istisna'a Revenue     XXX
                -> Recording costs
                    Dr. Istisna'a Cost of Sales     XXX
                    Cr. Work-in-Progress     XXX
                -> Profit Recognition
                    Dr. Profit & Loss (Istisna'a Profit)     XXX
                    Cr. Istisna'a Profit       XXX

                Dr. Bank / Cash     XXX
                Cr. Istisna'a Receivable     XXX
                
The final journal must include all Quarters interies and the final installement!
